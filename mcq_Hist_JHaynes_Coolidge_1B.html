                choices: [  
                    "A period of unprecedented and universal prosperity, marked by an absence of economic anxiety.",  
                    "A period of relative prosperity marked by deep sectoral inequalities and a sense of unease about the future.",  
                    "A period of stagnation and decline, with high unemployment and widespread poverty.",  
                    "A brief period of boom followed immediately by a devastating recession."  
                ],  
                correctAnswer: 1,  
                explanation: "Paul Johnson emphasizes that while the 1920s are often viewed through rose-tinted glasses, significant inequalities persisted.  Farmers, in particular, struggled, and there was a pervasive sense that the prosperity was fragile.  This unease played a role in Coolidge's policies.",

            },  
           {  
                question: "What was the primary economic challenge faced by American farmers in the early 1920s?",  
                choices: [  
                    "Excessive government regulation hindering production and innovation.",  
                    "A lack of access to credit and financial services.",  
                    "Overproduction and falling agricultural prices due to global competition.",  
                    "Widespread drought and crop failures across the Midwest."  
                ],  
                correctAnswer: 2,  
                explanation: "Paul Johnson notes that technological advancements during and after World War I led to a surge in agricultural production.  However, demand did not keep pace, resulting in a glut and a sharp decline in prices, which devastated many farmers.  This was exacerbated by increased competition from agricultural producers in other parts of the world.",

                question: "What was the significance of the Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act of 1922 in the context of Coolidge's 'Last Arcadia'?",  
                choices: [  
                    "It provided significant relief to struggling American farmers by raising tariffs on agricultural imports.",  
                    "It exacerbated the economic problems of farmers by further restricting international trade and limiting export opportunities.",  
                    "It had little impact on the agricultural sector, focusing primarily on protecting manufacturing industries.",  
                    "It represented a major step towards free trade and global economic integration."  
                ],  
                correctAnswer: 1,  
                explanation: "While often criticized, the Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act was seen by many at the time as a way to protect American industries, including agriculture, from foreign competition.  However, Paul Johnson nuances this by suggesting that it also had unintended consequences, such as making it harder for European nations to repay their war debts to the US.",

                question: "What was Coolidge's general philosophy regarding government intervention in the economy?",  
                choices: [  
                    "He believed in active government intervention to regulate markets and promote social welfare.",  
                    "He advocated for a completely laissez-faire approach, with minimal government involvement.",  
                    "He favored a balanced approach, with limited government intervention focused on maintaining a stable currency and enforcing contracts.",  
                    "He supported government ownership of key industries to ensure efficiency and equitable distribution of resources."  
                ],  
                correctAnswer: 2,  
                explanation: "Paul Johnson presents Coolidge as a staunch believer in limited government and individual responsibility. He saw government intervention as often creating more problems than it solved and preferred to rely on the market to allocate resources efficiently.",  
                reference: "Amity Paul Johnson, Coolidge (New York: HarperCollins, 2013), Chapter 1."  
            },

                question: "What role did technological advancements play in shaping the economic landscape of the 'Last Arcadia' era?",  
                choices: [  
                    "They primarily benefited urban areas, widening the gap between rural and urban prosperity.",  
                    "They had little impact on the overall economy, as their adoption was slow and uneven.",  
                    "They led to increased agricultural productivity and lower prices, contributing to the farmers' economic struggles.",  
                    "They primarily focused on improving transportation infrastructure, benefiting all sectors of the economy equally."  
                ],  
                correctAnswer: 0,  
                explanation: "Paul Johnson highlights the paradox of technological progress. While advancements like tractors and improved farming techniques increased output, they also exacerbated the problem of overproduction and falling prices, creating hardship for farmers who couldn't compete.",  
                reference: "Amity Paul Johnson, Coolidge (New York: HarperCollins, 2013), Chapter 1."

                question: "What was the political climate surrounding the issue of farm relief in the early 1920s?",  
                choices: [  
                    "There was a broad consensus among politicians that the government should provide direct financial assistance to farmers.",  
                    "The issue was highly divisive, with significant disagreements over the appropriate role of government and the best course of action.",  
                    "The issue was largely ignored by politicians, who were more focused on other economic and social problems.",  
                    "There was unanimous support for raising tariffs on agricultural imports to protect American farmers."  
                ],  
                correctAnswer: 1,  
                explanation: "Paul Johnson illustrates that the debate over farm relief was a major point of contention.  Some politicians favored government intervention and price supports, while others, like Coolidge, were wary of such measures, believing they would distort the market and create unintended consequences. This created a gridlocked political environment.",

                choices: [  
                    "It instilled a deep sense of optimism and confidence in the American economy's ability to overcome any challenge.",  
                    "It led to widespread fears of hyperinflation and economic collapse, as had occurred in some European countries.",  
                    "It created a sense of disillusionment with government intervention and a desire to return to a more laissez-faire approach.",  
                    "It had little impact on economic expectations, as most Americans quickly forgot about the war's economic consequences."  
                ],  
                correctAnswer: 2,  
                explanation: "The war led to a period of heavy government intervention in the economy. After the war, there was a strong reaction against this, with many Americans, including Coolidge, wanting to return to a system with less government involvement and greater individual freedom.",  
                reference: "Amity Paul Johnson, Coolidge (New York: HarperCollins, 2013), Chapter 1."

                ],  
                correctAnswer: 1,  
                explanation: "Coolidge believed in the power of individual initiative and private charity. He was wary of government programs, fearing they would create dependency and undermine individual responsibility. He saw private organizations as better equipped to address social needs.",

                ],  
                correctAnswer: 1,  
                explanation: "The rise of consumer culture, fueled by advertising and installment buying, created a sense of wanting more.

The relentless pursuit of consumption created a sense of underlying tension.",

                correctAnswer: 1,  
                explanation: "The 1920s saw a significant increase in the use of consumer credit. Installment buying allowed people to purchase goods they couldn't afford outright, fueling consumption and contributing to the economic boom. This marked a shift in attitudes towards debt.",

                correctAnswer: 1,  
                explanation: "Mellon, a staunch fiscal conservative, believed that lower taxes would stimulate investment and create jobs. His policies, which were largely supported by Coolidge, focused on reducing government debt and promoting economic growth through private enterprise.",
