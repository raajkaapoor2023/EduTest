const questions = [
  {
    q: "1. What is a morpheme in linguistics?",
    choices: [
      "A syllable in a word",
      "The smallest meaningful unit in a language",
      "A prefix or suffix only",
      "A type of phoneme"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `A morpheme is defined as the smallest unit of meaning or grammatical function in a language. (Booij, Geert. <em>The Grammar of Words</em>, 2007, p.1; Lieber, Rochelle. <em>Introducing Morphology</em>, 2021, p.5)`
  },
  {
    q: "2. What distinguishes a 'free morpheme' from a 'bound morpheme'?",
    choices: [
      "Free morphemes can stand alone as words; bound morphemes cannot",
      "Free morphemes are affixes; bound morphemes are roots",
      "Free morphemes do not carry meaning; bound morphemes do",
      "Bound morphemes can stand alone; free morphemes cannot"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `Free morphemes can appear independently as words (e.g., "book"), whereas bound morphemes (e.g., "-s") must attach to other morphemes. (Aronoff, Mark. <em>Minimalist Morphology</em>, 1994, p.12)`
  },
  {
    q: "3. Which of the following is an example of a prefix?",
    choices: [
      "-ing",
      "-ed",
      "un-",
      "-s"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `Prefixes are affixes attached before the root or stem, such as "un-" in "undo". Suffixes attach after the root. (Lieber, 2021, p.21)`
  },
  {
    q: "4. What is an infix?",
    choices: [
      "A morpheme occurring at the beginning of a word",
      "A morpheme occurring within a word",
      "A morpheme occurring at the end of a word",
      "A morpheme that does not change meaning"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `An infix is a morpheme inserted inside another morpheme or root, as in Tagalog "<em>um</em>" infixation. (Spencer, Andrew and Zwicky, Arnold. <em>The Handbook of Morphology</em>, 1998, p.117)`
  },
  {
    q: "5. What is the meaning of 'lexicon' in linguistics?",
    choices: [
      "The grammar of a language",
      "The set of phonemes in a language",
      "The mental dictionary of words and morphemes",
      "The syntax rules of a language"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `The lexicon is the mental repository storing words and morphemes with their meanings, pronunciations, and properties. (Booij, 2007, p.35)`
  },
  {
    q: "6. What is the common effect of suffixes in English?",
    choices: [
      "They change the meaning or grammatical category of the word",
      "They only adjust stress patterns",
      "They typically shorten words",
      "They only appear at the beginning of words"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `Suffixes typically modify word meaning or grammatical category, e.g., "happy" to "happiness" by adding "-ness". (Lieber, 2021, p.48)`
  },
  {
    q: "7. According to the lecture, what is reduplication?",
    choices: [
      "Repeating a whole or part of a word to change meaning",
      "Adding a prefix to a word",
      "Removing suffixes from a root",
      "Pronouncing a consonant twice"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `Reduplication involves repeating all or part of a morpheme to convey grammatical or semantic changes (common in Austronesian languages). (Spencer & Zwicky, 1998, p.253)`
  },
  {
    q: "8. Which of the following is an example of a bound root?",
    choices: [
      "Cat",
      "Un-",
      "Culp- (as in 'culpable')",
      "-s"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `Bound roots cannot stand alone and require affixes, e.g., 'culp-' from 'culpable'. (Booij, 2007, p.60)`
  },
  {
    q: "9. What is the difference between open-class and closed-class morphemes?",
    choices: [
      "Open-class morphemes rarely change, closed-class are flexible",
      "Open-class morphemes are closed sets (prepositions); closed-class are open sets (nouns)",
      "Open-class morphemes can be expanded with new words; closed-class are fixed (like pronouns)",
      "Open-class morphemes occur together; closed-class morphemes do not"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `Open-class categories (nouns, verbs) allow new members, while closed-class (pronouns, prepositions) are mostly fixed. (Lieber, 2021, p.72)`
  },
  {
    q: "10. What is 'templatic morphology' as explained in the lecture?",
    choices: [
      "A pattern where roots are made of consonants interspersed with vowels to form words",
      "A method of syllable counting",
      "Using prefixes exclusively",
      "A repeating of morphemes"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `Templatic morphology involves consonantal roots combined with vowel patterns to form words, typical in Semitic languages. (Aronoff, 1994, p.88)`
  },
  {
    q: "11. What is a 'bound morpheme'?",
    choices: [
      "A morpheme that can stand alone",
      "A morpheme that must attach to another morpheme",
      "A morpheme that includes prepositions only",
      "A morpheme representing a complete word"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Bound morphemes cannot occur independently and must attach to other morphemes; affixes are typical examples. (Booij, 2007, p.18)`
  },
  {
    q: "12. The distinction between 'prefix', 'suffix' and 'infix' is based on:",
    choices: [
      "Where in the word the morpheme attaches",
      "The meaning it adds to the word",
      "Its grammatical function",
      "Whether the morpheme is bound or free"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `These terms differ in attachment position: prefix before root, suffix after, infix inside root. (Lieber, 2021, p.38)`
  },
  {
    q: "13. Which of the following is NOT typically an open-class morpheme?",
    choices: [
      "Nouns",
      "Verbs",
      "Adjectives",
      "Prepositions"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: `Prepositions belong to closed-class morphemes; open-class includes nouns, verbs, adjectives. (Aarts, B. <em>Oxford Modern English Grammar</em>, 2011, p.45)`
  },
  {
    q: "14. In the example of Tagalog morphology, what is special about the past tense morpheme?",
    choices: [
      "It is a prefix",
      "It is an infix",
      "It is a suffix",
      "It does not exist"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `The past tense marker in Tagalog is an infix "-um-" inserted within the root. (Spencer & Zwicky, 1998, p.119)`
  },
  {
    q: "15. What is the common phonological effect when adding the English plural suffix '-s'?",
    choices: [
      "It always sounds like 's'",
      "It always sounds like 'z'",
      "It can sound like 's', 'z', or 'iz' depending on the root word’s final sound",
      "It is silent"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `The plural suffix '-s' manifests as /s/, /z/, or /ɪz/ according to phonological environment (e.g., cats /s/, dogs /z/, horses /ɪz/). (Booij, 2007, p.120)`
  },
  {
    q: "16. How does the mental lexicon treat complex words like 'cats'?",
    choices: [
      "As one indivisible unit",
      "As a root plus a meaningful suffix",
      "Only as a sound pattern",
      "It ignores plural suffixes"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `The lexicon stores complex words as decomposed morphologically: root + suffix (cat + -s), enabling rule-based processing. (Lieber, 2021, p.55)`
  },
  {
    q: "17. What is morphological analysis?",
    choices: [
      "Parsing sentences into words",
      "Determining phonemes in speech",
      "Breaking down words into morphemes and analyzing their meaning/function",
      "Studying semantics"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `Morphological analysis segments words into component morphemes and studies their meanings and grammatical roles. (Aronoff, 1994, p.15)`
  },
  {
    q: "18. What kind of morpheme is '-er' in English words like 'teacher' and 'beggar'?",
    choices: [
      "Prefix",
      "Suffix denoting agent/person",
      "Infix",
      "Root"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `The suffix "-er" is an agentive suffix indicating 'one who does', forming nouns from verbs. (Booij, 2007, p.73)`
  },
  {
    q: "19. According to the lecture, what is 'truncation' in morphology?",
    choices: [
      "Adding extra sounds to create words",
      "Removing part of a word to create a new form",
      "Repeating a morpheme",
      "Pronouncing words softly"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Truncation deletes part of a word to derive a related form, as in colloquial shortenings. (Spencer & Zwicky, 1998, p.264)`
  },
  {
    q: "20. What is the typical behavior of tone in 'tonal languages' as morphological markers?",
    choices: [
      "They carry no meaning",
      "Tone changes can distinguish word meaning or grammatical functions",
      "Tone is only important in poetry",
      "Tone replaces consonants"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `In tonal languages, tone variation often marks lexical or grammatical distinctions, functioning morphologically. (Lieber, 2021, p.97)`
