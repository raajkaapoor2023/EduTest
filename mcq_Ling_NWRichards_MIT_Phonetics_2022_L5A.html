      "A consonant sound followed by a vowel",
      "A silent vowel"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `A diphthong is a vowel sound that begins with one vowel quality and glides to another within the same syllable. (Small, 2025, p.32)`
  },
  {
    q: "11. Which physiological structures are primarily involved in speech production?",
    choices: [

      "Eyes and ears",
      "Stomach and diaphragm only"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Speech involves articulators such as vocal folds (larynx), tongue, lips, and the velum (soft palate). (Small, 2025, p.10)`
  },
  {

    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Manner of articulation describes how airflow is blocked or constricted: stops, fricatives, nasals, etc. (Small, 2025, p.21)`
  },
  {
    q: "13. What distinguishes oral from nasal sounds?",
    choices: [
      "Oral sounds are louder",
      "Oral sounds have air released only through the mouth; nasal sounds through the nose",
      "Nasal sounds are only vowels",
      "Oral sounds are always voiceless"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Oral sounds release air only through the mouth; nasal sounds allow airflow through the nasal cavity. (Small, 2025, p.20)`
  },

      "Velaric ingressive",

      "A speech disorder",
      "Stress on syllables"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Coarticulation occurs because sounds influence each other during continuous speech production. (Small, 2025, p.38)`
  },
  {
    q: "19. What role does the velum play in speech?",
    choices: [
      "Controls vocal fold vibration",

      "Regulates airflow from lungs",
      "Controls tongue movement"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `The velum raises to close off nasal passages for oral sounds and lowers to open them for nasal sounds. (Small, 2025, p.20)`
  },
  {
    q: "20. What is a spectrogram?",
    choices: [
      "A blood flow chart",
