        question: "Lecture IX introduces the concept of locutionary acts. A locutionary act is:",
        options: [
          "Uttering noises, words, and their meaning",
          "The intended effect on the listener",
          "The speaker's mental state",
          "A written inscription"
        ],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "A locutionary act covers uttering sounds (phonetic), forming words (phatic), and conveying meaning (rhetic)."
      },
      {
        question: "An illocutionary act differs from a locutionary act by:",
        options: [
          "Focusing on effect on the world",
          "Being purely phonetic",
          "Carrying a conventional force like warning",
          "Remaining entirely internal"
        ],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "Illocutionary acts use conventions to perform acts like informing or ordering."
      },

        question: "A perlocutionary act refers to:",
        options: [
          "A blunt factual report",
          "The speaker's intention",
          "The grammatical mood",
          "The effects upon listeners"
        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "Perlocutionary acts capture consequences such as persuading or amusing the listener."
      },

        question: "Which formula distinguishes illocutionary from perlocutionary acts?",
        options: [
          "By saying x I did y",
          "If x then y",
          "Because x, y",
          "In saying x I was doing y"
        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "'In saying x I was doing y' highlights force (illocution) rather than effect."
      },

          "Under x then y",
          "Because x, y"

        options: [
          "Ignoring meaning",
          "Drawing a hard line after the utterance",
          "Merging both acts",
          "Focusing on syntax"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "He argues the illocutionary act ends when force is performed; consequences come after."
      },
      {
        question: "Locutionary and illocutionary acts are related how?",
        options: [
          "They can occur separately",

          "They are identical",
          "Locution includes illocution"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Every illocutionary act involves a locutionary act, but not vice versa."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does Austin reject reducing illocutions to perlocutions?",
        options: [
          "Effects vary widely",
          "Perlocutions are grammatical",
          "Illocutions are meaningless",
          "Locutions come first"
        ],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "Consequences are too broad—illocutions are defined by conventions, not by any effect."
      },
      {
        question: "Which is NOT a feature of the perlocutionary act?",
        options: [
          "Persuading",
          "Causing a reaction",
          "Securing uptake",
          "Convincing"
        ],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "Securing uptake is an illocutionary goal; perlocutions focus on actual consequences."
      },
      {
        question: "A judge’s verdict that installs a law is best classified as a:",
        options: [
          "Locutionary act",
          "Illocutionary act",
          "Perlocutionary act",
          "Rhetic act"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Delivering a legal judgment exercises institutional force—an illocution."
      },

      // Lecture X (11–20)
      {
        question: "Lecture X examines 'in' vs. 'by' formulas. Which use of 'in' accounts for the means or manner?",

          "In doing A I was doing B (process)",
          "In doing A I was doing B (criterion)",
          "In A I did B (goal)",
          "In B I did A (inverse)"
        ],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "The 'process' sense: 'in doing A I was doing B' marks how A involves B as method."
      },
      {
        question: "Which use of 'in' marks a criterion rather than a process?",
        options: [
          "In doing A I was doing B (process)",
          "In doing A I was in the process of doing B",
          "In being A I did B",
          "In A I did B"
        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "The 'criterion' sense: 'In doing A I was B' classifies the act under B."
      },
      {
        question: "To test if 'in saying x I was y-ing' names an illocution, you check if:",
        options: [
          "y can appear in non-continuous tense",
          "in can be replaced by by",
          "x is a question",
          "y is a noun"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "If 'in' can’t become 'by' without oddness, it likely names an illocution."
      },
      {
        question: "Which verb resists the 'in' test, showing perlocutionary force?",
        options: [
          "Warn",
          "Persuade",
          "Order",
          "Promise"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "'In saying x I was persuading him' feels off; we prefer 'By saying x I persuaded him.'"
      },
      {
        question: "When 'by' is used in a criterion sense, it:",
        options: [
          "Marks a method",
          "Indicates result",
          "Specifies classification",
          "Signals an apology"
        ],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "The 'criterion' sense of 'by' helps label the act (e.g., 'By saying x I was naming it.')."
      },
      {
        question: "Austin’s criteria with 'in' and 'by' are:",
        options: [
          "Perfect and exhaustive",
          "Slippery and partial tests",
          "Purely grammatical rules",
          "Universal laws"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "He warns they remain informal, “slippery tests,” not fixed definitions."
      },
      {
        question: "Which substitution often flips illocutionary to perlocutionary framing?",
        options: [
          "In → to",
          "In → by",
          "By → in",
          "To → in"
        ],

      },

        question: "Using 'in' with a non-verbal act produces:",
        options: [
          "Illocution",
          "Perlocution",
          "Locution",
          "Mixed signals"
        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "'In' formulas extend beyond speech acts, leading to ambiguity."

        question: "The 'by' formula in 'By uttering x I achieved y' best captures:",
        options: [

          "Perlocutionary consequences",
          "Rhetic meaning"
        ],

        explanation: "It highlights the actual result or effect of the utterance on the audience."

        options: [

          "Heuristic guidelines",
          "Unusable"
        ],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "They serve as loose heuristics rather than strict analytical tools."
      },

      // Lecture XI (21–30)
      {
        question: "Lecture XI asks whether statements are always mere constatives. He finds that statements:",
        options: [
          "Never entertain infelicities",
          "Always escape illocution",
          "Also carry illocutionary acts",
          "Are only perlocutions"
        ],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "He shows 'He did not X' can also perform an illocutionary act like protesting."
      },
      {
        question: "Austin shows a verdictive utterance like 'I find you guilty' is:",
        options: [
          "Only a statement",

          "Both statement and performative",
          "Neither"
        ],
        answer: 2,

      },
      {
        question: "Which dimension do statements and performatives share, per Lecture XI?",
        options: [

          "Both felicity and truth",
          "Neither"
        ],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "Both can be felicitous/infelicitous and true/false in different senses."
      },
      {
        question: "Austin warns that the classification of utterances into two boxes is:",
        options: [
          "Necessary and clear",

          "Determined solely by grammar",
          "Legally mandated"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "He calls the strict performative/constative split an oversimplification."
      },

        ],
