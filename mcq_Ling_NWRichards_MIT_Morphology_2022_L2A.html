const questions = [
  {
    q: "1. What is a morpheme in linguistics?",
    choices: [
      "A syllable in a word",
      "The smallest meaningful unit in a language",
      "A prefix or suffix only",
      "A type of phoneme"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a language, such as 'cat' or the suffix '-s' indicating plural. (Richards, MIT OCW Morphology Lecture 2, 2023)"
  },
  {
    q: "2. What distinguishes a 'free morpheme' from a 'bound morpheme'?",
    choices: [
      "Free morphemes can stand alone as words; bound morphemes cannot",
      "Free morphemes are affixes; bound morphemes are roots",
      "Free morphemes do not carry meaning; bound morphemes do",
      "Bound morphemes can stand alone; free morphemes cannot"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Free morphemes can function independently as words ('cat'), while bound morphemes must attach to roots or stems ('-s'). (Richards, MIT OCW Morphology Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "3. Which of the following is an example of a prefix?",
    choices: [
      "-ing",
      "-ed",
      "un-",
      "-s"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "A prefix attaches before the root, such as 'un-' in 'unhappy'. Suffixes like '-ing' and '-ed' attach after. (MIT OCW Morphology Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "4. What is an infix?",
    choices: [
      "A morpheme occurring at the beginning of a word",

      "A morpheme occurring at the end of a word",
      "A morpheme that does not change meaning"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Infixes are morphemes inserted inside a word, common in languages like Tagalog (e.g., '-um-'). (MIT OCW Morphology Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "5. What is the meaning of 'lexicon' in linguistics?",
    choices: [
      "The grammar of a language",

      "The mental dictionary of words and morphemes",
      "The syntax rules of a language"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "A lexicon is the mental repository of words and morphemes that a speaker knows, including pronunciation and meaning. (Richards, Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "6. What is the common effect of suffixes in English?",
    choices: [
      "They change the meaning or grammatical category of the word",
      "They only adjust stress patterns",
      "They typically shorten words",
      "They only appear at the beginning of words"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Suffixes like '-ness' or '-able' modify meaning or word class, e.g., 'happy' to 'happiness'. (MIT OCW Morphology Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "7. According to the lecture, what is reduplication?",
    choices: [
      "Repeating a whole or part of a word to change meaning",
      "Adding a prefix to a word",
      "Removing suffixes from a root",
      "Pronouncing a consonant twice"
    ],
    correct: 0,

  },
  {
    q: "8. Which of the following is an example of a bound root?",
    choices: [
      "Cat",
      "Un-",
      "Culp- (as in 'culpable')",
      "-s"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Bound roots like 'culp-' cannot stand alone and need affixes (e.g., culpable). (MIT OCW Morphology Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "9. What is the difference between open-class and closed-class morphemes?",
    choices: [
      "Open-class morphemes rarely change, closed-class are flexible",
      "Open-class morphemes are closed sets (prepositions); closed-class are open sets (nouns)",
      "Open-class morphemes can be expanded with new words; closed-class are fixed (like pronouns)",
      "Open-class morphemes occur together; closed-class morphemes do not"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Open-class morphemes include nouns and verbs, which expand with new words. Closed-class morphemes include pronouns and prepositions, which stay mostly constant. (Richards, MIT OCW Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "10. What is 'templatic morphology' as explained in the lecture?",
    choices: [
      "A pattern where roots are made of consonants interspersed with vowels to form words",
      "A method of syllable counting",
      "Using prefixes exclusively",
      "A repeating of morphemes"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Templatic morphology (e.g., in Semitic languages) involves roots made of consonant patterns with vowels inserted to create verb forms. (MIT OCW Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "11. What is a 'bound morpheme'?",
    choices: [
      "A morpheme that can stand alone",
      "A morpheme that must attach to another morpheme",
      "A morpheme that includes prepositions only",
      "A morpheme representing a complete word"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Bound morphemes cannot stand alone and must attach to free morphemes (e.g., '-s', 'un-'). (Lecture 2, MIT OCW)"
  },
  {
    q: "12. The distinction between 'prefix', 'suffix' and 'infix' is based on:",
    choices: [
      "Where in the word the morpheme attaches",
      "The meaning it adds to the word",
      "Its grammatical function",
      "Whether the morpheme is bound or free"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "'Prefix' attaches before, 'suffix' after, and 'infix' inside a root or stem. (MIT OCW Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "13. Which of the following is NOT typically an open-class morpheme?",
    choices: [
      "Nouns",
      "Verbs",
      "Adjectives",
      "Prepositions"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Prepositions are closed-class morphemes, with a fixed inventory. Nouns, verbs, adjectives are open-class. (Lect. 2, MIT OCW)"
  },
  {
    q: "14. In the example of Tagalog morphology, what is special about the past tense morpheme?",
    choices: [
      "It is a prefix",
      "It is an infix",
      "It is a suffix",
      "It does not exist"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "In Tagalog, the past tense morpheme '-um-' is an infix inserted after the first consonant or before the first vowel. (MIT OCW Morphology Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "15. What is the common phonological effect when adding the English plural suffix '-s'?",
    choices: [
      "It always sounds like 's'",
      "It always sounds like 'z'",
      "It can sound like 's', 'z', or 'iz' depending on the root word’s final sound",
      "It is silent"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "The plural suffix -s varies phonologically as /s/, /z/, or /ɪz/ depending on phonetic environment (e.g., cats, dogs, horses). (Richards, MIT OCW Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "16. How does the mental lexicon treat complex words like 'cats'?",
    choices: [
      "As one indivisible unit",
      "As a root plus a meaningful suffix",
      "Only as a sound pattern",
      "It ignores plural suffixes"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The lexicon treats 'cats' as composed of root 'cat' plus suffix '-s', supported by productive morphological rules. (Lecture 2, Richards)"
  },
  {
    q: "17. What is morphological analysis?",
    choices: [
      "Parsing sentences into words",
      "Determining phonemes in speech",
      "Breaking down words into morphemes and analyzing their meaning/function",

  {
    q: "18. What kind of morpheme is '-er' in English words like 'teacher' and 'beggar'?",
    choices: [
      "Prefix",
      "Suffix denoting agent/person",
      "Infix",
      "Root"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Suffix '-er' attached to verbs forms nouns indicating the agent performing the action: 'teach'-> 'teacher'. (MIT OCW Morphology Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "19. According to the lecture, what is 'truncation' in morphology?",
    choices: [
      "Adding extra sounds to create words",

    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Truncation removes segments of a morpheme or word to form related words, such as some verb forms in O’odham language. (MIT OCW Morphology Lecture 2)"
  },
  {
    q: "20. What is the typical behavior of tone in 'tonal languages' as morphological markers?",
    choices: [
      "They carry no meaning",
