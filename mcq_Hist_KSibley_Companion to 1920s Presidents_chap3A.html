const quiz = [
  {
    q: "Goodall argues the central contradiction of US foreign policy in the 1920s was:",
    choices: [
      "A deliberate withdrawal from all international economic activity.",
      "A growing global economic power constrained by domestic politics and anti-entanglement culture.",
      "A unified national consensus in favor of an expansive standing army.",
      "A decision to make the League of Nations the sole instrument of policy."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall frames the era as one of 'dynamism and experimentation' but also 'disability': the United States had unparalleled economic reach yet faced strong domestic resistance to multilateral entanglements — a political constraint that shaped policy choices. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}"
  },

  {
    q: "Which domestic figure and faction most consistently blocked multilateral commitments such as qualified participation in the World Court?",
    choices: [
      "Senator William E. Borah and the anti-interventionist Republicans.",
      "Speaker of the House advocating full League entry.",
      "Progressive Democrats seeking isolation.",
      "Southern Democrats favoring European entanglement."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Goodall identifies Senator William E. Borah and the anti-interventionist wing of the GOP as a decisive barrier to administration foreign-policy aims, often more constraining than party rivals. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}"
  },

  {
    q: "The 1924 Foreign Service Act is important because it:",
    choices: [
      "Disbanded the diplomatic service and handed diplomacy to private firms.",
      "Merged diplomatic and consular services, introduced competitive exams and reorganized personnel — but did not instantly erase old-boy influences.",
      "Created the CIA.",
      "Mandated senators personally run overseas posts."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The 1924 Act merged services and introduced merit examinations and retirement ages, professionalizing the service; Goodall notes, however, that entrenched social biases and 'old boys' patterns persisted in practice. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}"
  },

  {
    q: "How does Goodall read the Dawes Plan and similar credit arrangements of the early 1920s?",
    choices: [
      "As a durable political settlement that avoided future crises indefinitely.",
      "As short-term economic stabilization that entrenched reliance on US loans and created fragile international financial linkages.",
      "As an explicit military alliance with Germany.",
      "As unrelated to US foreign policy."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall (building on scholarship cited in the chapter) treats the Dawes Plan as a temporary fix: it reconnected Europe financially to US capital but produced structural fragility when reparations and payments proved unsustainable. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}"
  },

  {
    q: "The Stimson Doctrine (nonrecognition of Manchukuo) is best characterized, in Goodall’s account, as:",
    choices: [
      "An immediate and effective deterrent that reversed Japanese expansion.",
      "A moral-legal statement of nonrecognition that was symbolically important but practically limited in preventing Japan’s consolidation in Manchuria.",
      "A declaration that the US would invade Manchuria.",
      "A domestic program of social reform."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall discusses the Stimson Doctrine as a principled nonrecognition stance; while notable diplomatically, it ultimately failed to halt Japan and exposed the limits of law-based policies absent enforcement. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}"
  },

  {
    q: "What was Hoover’s principal tactical achievement at the London Naval Conference (1930), according to Goodall?",
    choices: [
      "A three-power agreement (US–UK–Japan) that slowed an Anglo-American naval race and temporarily reduced naval spending.",
      "A plan to sink both the US and British navies.",
      "A unilateral US decision to expand its fleet without consultation.",
      "A binding guarantee of British colonial territories to the US."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Goodall highlights Hoover (and Stimson’s delegation) convening London 1930 as consolidating the Washington system — securing cooperation between the largest naval powers and enabling brief reductions in naval armaments. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}"
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall emphasizes a major internal contradiction in Republican-era economic diplomacy: that administrations simultaneously...",
    choices: [
      "Advocated free trade abroad while adopting protectionist measures at home, complicating international economic stability.",
      "Refused all private business involvement overseas.",
      "Nationalized foreign industries by treaty.",
      "Sought to abolish US corporations operating abroad."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "The chapter stresses the tension between active capital export and investment overseas and recurring domestic protectionism (and later tariffs like Smoot–Hawley), producing mixed signals and policy fragility. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}"
  },

  {
    q: "How does Goodall characterize Herbert Hoover’s pre-presidential and presidential approach to international problems?",
    choices: [
      "A faith in voluntary associationalism and private economic actors to manage international issues (economic modernization as diplomacy).",
      "An insistence on full-scale military occupation everywhere.",
      "A doctrinaire Wilsonian internationalism with immediate League membership.",
      "An isolationist who cut all foreign trade ties."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Goodall (citing Leffler and others) situates Hoover’s approach as transitional — relying on commerce, private actors, and voluntary coordination rather than grand diplomatic coercion. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}"
  },

  {
    q: "Which policy toward Latin America does Goodall credit to Hoover’s administration?",
    choices: [
      "A strict increase of troop deployments to the region throughout 1929–1933.",
      "Measured withdrawal of US troops from places like Nicaragua and Haiti, paired with economic modernization initiatives.",
      "An immediate grant of independence to all Caribbean territories.",
      "A policy of total disengagement with no diplomatic contact."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall notes Hoover’s efforts to improve relations in Latin America included troop withdrawals (e.g., Nicaragua, Haiti) and programs aimed at economic modernization, though strategic calculations remained central. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}"
  },

  {
    q: "In Goodall’s chapter, the 1924 Immigration Act’s diplomatic consequence was to:",
    choices: [
      "Harmonize US–Japan relations permanently.",
      "Create diplomatic friction with Japan (racial implications) though formal relations remained cordial through much of the 1920s.",
      "Lead to immediate military alliance with Japan.",
      "Have no effect on foreign policy."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall observes that the 1924 immigration law introduced tensions — particularly with Japan — even if bilateral relations remained outwardly stable until later crises. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}"
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall and cited scholars argue that the US diplomatic corps in the 1920s was still constrained because:",
    choices: [
      "It was expansive and overprofessionalized.",
      "It remained small, underpaid, and socially exclusive, limiting state capacity despite reforms like the Foreign Service Act.",
      "All diplomats were selected by popular vote.",
      "It had total control over domestic economic policy."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall stresses institutional limits: a compact, often socially elite diplomatic service that only slowly professionalized, constraining America’s ability to project power effectively. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}"
  },

  {
    q: "Which strategic rationale underpinned some US reluctance to grant Philippine independence in the early 1930s?",
    choices: [
      "The belief that Philippine independence would strengthen the balance of power in East Asia.",
      "Concerns that independence would weaken US naval and regional strategic posture (parity arguments) and complicate Pacific arrangements.",
      "A plan to annex the Philippines into the continental US.",
      "No strategic rationale — it was purely sentimental."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall (via analysis of Hoover and Stimson) indicates strategic concerns — maintaining Pacific naval capacity and regional balance — informed resistance to rapid decolonization (e.g., vetoes and debates over Hare–Hawes–Cutting). :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}"
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall treats the naval treaties of the 1920s–30s as:",
    choices: [
      "Irrelevant pageantry with no strategic outcome.",
      "Important frameworks that limited expensive races and re-shaped naval strategy (and indirectly stimulated carrier and tactical innovation).",
      "Direct causes of the Great Depression.",
      "Solely British domestic politics."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The chapter shows that arms-limitation treaties constrained budgets, shifted naval priorities, and encouraged tactical innovation (e.g., carriers and multi-role ships), while also having geopolitical side-effects. "
  },

  {
    q: "How does Goodall characterize Henry Stimson’s attitude to treaty violations (e.g., Manchuria)?",
    choices: [
      "As indifferent and uninterested in treaty commitments.",
      "As personally affronted — a moral and honor-driven statesman who believed treaties and international law mattered, and thus reacted strongly to Japanese moves.",
      "As enthusiastically supportive of Japanese expansion.",
      "As an isolationist who favored no diplomatic response."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall reports Stimson’s visceral reaction to Japan’s treaty breaches: for him, treaty obligations were a matter of principle and honor, shaping the force and tone of US protest. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}"
  },

  {
    q: "The chapter suggests American corporate expansion abroad in the 1920s produced which mix of outcomes?",
    choices: [
      "Solely benevolent modernization for host societies.",
      "Rapid profit and global market penetration for US firms, but also local dislocations, resentment, and geopolitical entanglements.",
      "Complete elimination of all local industry worldwide.",
      "Immediate global democracy as a result of corporate presence."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall documents how US firms (ITT, Ford, Standard Oil, United Fruit) expanded globally — powering US influence and exports but generating economic dependencies and local grievances (e.g., Fordlandia). :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}"
  },

  {
    q: "Which historiographical corrective does Goodall emphasize about the 1920s 'isolationism' label?",
    choices: [
      "That the label is entirely accurate and needs no nuance.",
      "That the binary 'isolation vs internationalism' is misleading; the decade featured active international economic engagement and selective multilateralism even as entangling alliances were politically suspect.",
      "That the US was completely isolationist with no foreign contacts.",
      "That only cultural history matters for foreign policy."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall — echoing recent scholarship — rejects narrow binaries: though political anti-entanglement existed, the US engaged broadly through economic ties, treaty-building, and selective multilateral initiatives. "
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall argues that one long-term effect of US loan and trade policies in the 1920s was:",
    choices: [
      "A perfectly balanced and self-correcting global financial system.",
      "A global economic integration that increased short-term growth but left systemic vulnerabilities exposed by shocks (e.g., late-decade defaults).",
      "Immediate world peace guaranteed by credit.",
      "An isolationist economy impervious to external influence."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The chapter explains how US credit and investment fueled exports and growth but also created fragile cross-border financial dependencies that could unravel under stress. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}"
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall suggests the American military posture in the 1920s and early 1930s was best described as:",
    choices: [
      "Aggressively expansionist with maximum budgets for all services.",
      "Constrained by cutbacks and arms-limitation agreements; forced to innovate tactically under budgetary limits.",
      "Completely demobilized with no capabilities.",
      "An immediate precursor to total global occupation policy."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall notes budget cuts and treaty constraints reduced conventional forces but stimulated tactical innovation (aircraft carriers, Marines' amphibious tactics), altering future military development. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}"
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall discusses Anglo-American relations in the late 1920s — his view is that:",
    choices: [
      "They were uniformly antagonistic due to trade alone.",
      "They contained cooperation on arms control and economic diplomacy but were frayed by divergent colonial and regional interests (Ireland, Middle East, debts).",
      "The US surrendered all its interests to Britain.",
      "They were irrelevant to Pacific strategy."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The chapter records attempts at cooperation (naval conferences, Rapidan summit) but also stresses lingering bilateral disputes that limited deep alignment. "
  },

  {
    q: "Which diplomatic instrument did Republicans often prefer to formal League membership?",
    choices: [
      "Qualified participation in international courts and selective treaty commitments; informal economic diplomacy and bilateral arrangements.",
      "Immediate territorial annexation of all partners.",
      "Universal unconditional submissions to the League.",
      "No diplomacy at all."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Goodall shows Republican governments frequently favored selective multilateralism (World Court, limited treaty engagement) and informal economic tools rather than full League commitment. "
  },

  {
    q: "How does Goodall treat the role of legalism (e.g., Kellogg–Briand) in US policy?",
    choices: [
      "As a primary replacement for force — always decisive in crises.",
      "As an aspirational language of international order that often lacked enforcement and therefore had mixed practical effect.",
      "As an immediate cause of war.",
      "As solely a domestic legal reform."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The chapter argues that legal instruments expressed high-minded aims (Kellogg–Briand, Stimson’s reliance on treaty norms) but their lack of enforcement mechanisms limited their deterrent effect. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}"
  },

  {
    q: "In Goodall's survey, what best explains the limits of US capacity to project power globally during the 1920s?",
    choices: [
      "Unlimited resources but no strategic imagination.",
      "A combination of constrained institutional capacity (small diplomatic corps), domestic political resistance, and competing regional priorities.",
      "A lack of any economic resources after World War I.",
      "A conscious policy of universal empire-building everywhere."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall emphasizes multiple constraints — limited diplomatic manpower, domestic politics hostile to entanglement, and divergent regional demands — which together limited sustained power projection. "
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall’s treatment of the 1920s suggests that the US cultural reach (films, consumption, corporations) produced:",
    choices: [
      "Only beneficial cultural exchange with no political consequence.",
      "Soft-power influence that complemented economic penetration and complicated local politics abroad.",
      "Immediate military alliances worldwide.",
      "Total cultural isolation."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The chapter notes the spread of American films, brands, and corporate presence as a form of soft power that reshaped foreign markets and perceptions and fed into diplomacy and economic policy. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}"
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall places the Manchurian crisis (1931) in his narrative primarily to show:",
    choices: [
      "That Asian crises were irrelevant to US policy makers.",
      "How legalistic doctrines, moral outrage, and limited enforcement exposed the limits of interwar American diplomacy.",
      "That the US eagerly used military force in Manchuria.",
      "That China had no role in US strategic thinking."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Manchuria illustrates the gap between principle and capability: despite nonrecognition and moral protest, the US lacked the political will and means to reverse Japanese actions — a central Goodall theme. "
  },

  {
    q: "Which long-term interpretive point about the 1920s does Goodall advance?",
    choices: [
      "That the decade was irrelevant and left no legacy.",
      "That while the 1920s showed important continuities with Wilsonian institutionalism, it was also marked by distinct constraints that shaped later interwar outcomes.",
      "That the 1920s were the absolute apogee of global democracy.",
      "That nothing in the 1920s anticipated World War II."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall argues the decade cannot be reduced to simple 'decline' or 'isolation' — it combined continuities (institutions, treaties, economic globalization) with constraints and choices that affected later crises. "
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall’s chapter suggests the US response to Japanese policy in China was complicated because:",
    choices: [
      "The US had no commercial or strategic interests in Asia.",
      "The US balanced treaty principles, domestic politics, Anglo-American sensitivities, and limited enforcement options — producing hesitant, principle-led but weak responses.",
      "The US immediately declared war on Japan in 1932.",
      "The US ceded all influence to France."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Competing priorities (treaty norms, public suspicion of entanglement, limited naval willingness, and Anglo-American disagreements) produced calibrated but ultimately ineffectual responses to Japanese actions. "
  },

  {
    q: "According to Goodall, which institutional innovation in the 1920s helped to professionalize US diplomacy (even if imperfectly)?",
    choices: [
      "The creation of a presidential standing army with unelected generals.",
      "Founding of Georgetown's School of Foreign Service (1919) and the 1924 Foreign Service Act reforms.",
      "The abolition of all exams for diplomats.",
      "The direct election of ambassadors by popular ballot."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall notes the emergence of the School of Foreign Service (1919) and the 1924 Act as steps toward professional training and merit-based personnel, though social and budgetary limits persisted. :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}"
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall uses examples of tariff politics and corporate behavior to argue that US foreign policy in the 1920s was:",
    choices: [
      "Purely driven by military officers with no commercial inputs.",
      "Deeply intertwined with private economic interests whose global reach both enabled and complicated official policy.",
      "Only a cultural project with no economic elements.",
      "Entirely run by foreign governments."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The chapter underscores how private capital, corporate expansion, and tariff politics shaped diplomatic priorities and constrained coherent policy-making. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}"
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall’s assessment of the value of arms-limitation treaties for international order is best rendered as:",
    choices: [
      "They were decisive and prevented any future great-power tension.",
      "They provided momentary restraint and institutional frameworks but did not eliminate geostrategic competition or long-term instability.",
      "They were equivalent to unconditional world government.",
      "They were purely symbolic with zero technical effect on navies."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall treats these treaties as real achievements that lowered immediate arms competition but could not resolve deeper rivalries or prevent future conflict. "
  },

  {
    q: "Which best captures Goodall’s view of Henry Stimson’s legacy in the chapter?",
    choices: [
      "A uniformly praised diplomat whose every decision was uncontested.",
      "A contested figure — widely respected for principle and competence but criticized for policies that some argue antagonized rivals and lacked realism.",
      "A marginal footnote with no influence.",
      "A purely domestic politician with no foreign policy role."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall surveys the literature: Stimson elicits admiration for his principled stance and administrative skill but also criticism that some of his actions (tone, legalism) may have had adverse consequences. "
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall argues that the US attempted to manage international problems largely by:",
    choices: [
      "Deploying large standing armies on every continent.",
      "Using economic leverage, treaties, limited naval diplomacy and selective multilateralism rather than broad military coalitions.",
      "Surrendering all agency to the League.",
      "Adopting a doctrine of complete unilateral conquest."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The chapter emphasizes reliance on economic diplomacy, credit, selective treaty frameworks, and naval/consular presence — a 'commercial' and legalistic repertoire rather than expeditionary conquest. "
  },

  {
    q: "In Goodall’s reading, what was a common shortcoming of interwar legal and moral condemnations (e.g., Stimson Doctrine, Kellogg–Briand)?",
    choices: [
      "They always required immediate military occupation.",
      "They often lacked enforcement mechanisms and thus depended on political will that frequently proved absent.",
      "They instantly solved underlying power politics.",
      "They were universally implemented by all states without exception."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall stresses the recurring problem: moral-legal pronouncements signaled values but could not substitute for credible deterrence or collective action. "
  },

  {
    q: "Goodall’s chapter links US business expansion to which diplomatic consequence in peripheral regions?",
    choices: [
      "Strengthened local democracies everywhere.",
      "Economic penetration that sometimes provoked nationalist backlash and required protective naval or consular measures (e.g., in China and Latin America).",
      "Immediate universal prosperity and no resistance.",
      "Complete withdrawal of US companies from Latin America."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall shows corporate involvement often created local tensions — for which the US sometimes resorted to protective patrols, interventions, or diplomatic pressure. "
  },

  {
    q: "Which phrase best summarizes Goodall’s final evaluative stance on the Republican-era foreign policy?",
    choices: [
      "Unambiguously triumphant and the model for all future policy.",
      "A mixture of institutional continuity and practical constraint — competent in parts, limited in effect by domestic politics and structural weaknesses.",
      "Total failure with no redeeming features.",
      "Completely irrelevant to international history."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Goodall urges a balanced reading: the era shows both important continuities (institutions, treaties) and clear limits due to politics and capacity, making it complex rather than wholly successful or failed. "
