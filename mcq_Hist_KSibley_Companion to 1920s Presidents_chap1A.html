const quiz = [
  {
    q: "Christopher McKnight Nichols defines 'Wilsonianism' primarily as:",
    choices: [
      "A doctrine of strict isolation and non-intervention in European affairs.",
      "An idealistic liberal internationalism emphasizing self-determination, collective security, and economic interconnection.",
      "A domestic social program favoring decentralized governance and state autonomy.",
      "A laissez-faire economic creed opposing federal regulation of finance and trade."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols, summarizing the chapter, clarifies that Wilsonianism denotes an idealistic, liberal internationalist posture — rooted in Wilson’s Fourteen Points, the League project, and an emphasis on self-determination and collective security rather than isolation. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which two major domestic institutions formed under Wilson that Nichols highlights as foundational to later federal policy?",
    choices: [
      "The Civilian Conservation Corps and Social Security.",
      "The Federal Reserve System and the federal income tax (16th Amendment implementation).",
      "The TVA and the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The Interstate Commerce Commission and the War Industries Board."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols highlights Wilson’s domestic legislative imprint — notably the creation of a modern Federal Reserve and the establishment of a federal income tax framework — as structural achievements that shaped later federal governance. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "The difference between Wilson's 'New Freedom' and Roosevelt’s 'New Nationalism' chiefly concerned:",
    choices: [
      "How to prosecute foreign wars and manage the League of Nations.",
      "The role of the federal government in regulating and/or managing corporate consolidation.",
      "Whether to grant women suffrage before or after 1920.",
      "Tax rates on agricultural income."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      The chapter emphasizes that Wilson’s 'New Freedom' and Roosevelt’s 'New Nationalism' diverged most sharply over corporate power: Wilson wanted to restore competition and break trusts; Roosevelt accepted a larger, regulatory federal role to manage big business. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which interpretive 'layer' of Wilson scholarship concerns debates about whether Wilson’s reforms were genuinely 'progressive' or were limited/corporatist in scope?",
    choices: [
      "The 'constitutional' layer.",
      "The 'progressivism' layer (how progressive were the reforms?).",
      "The 'economic determinism' layer.",
      "The 'imperial nostalgia' layer."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols organizes Wilson historiography into several layers; the first explicitly interrogates how 'progressive' Wilson and his reforms truly were, balancing praise (Blum, Link) against critiques that emphasize limits or corporatist tendencies. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "According to Nichols, what role did Wilson's health play in his presidency, especially during the League ratification fight?",
    choices: [
      "No documented role; Wilson was in robust health throughout his term.",
      "His deteriorating health (strokes/arteriosclerosis) contributed to political intransigence and affected the League fight's outcome.",
      "His health problems enhanced his flexibility and openness to Senate compromise.",
      "Health issues only surfaced after he left office and had no impact on policy."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols discusses research showing Wilson suffered progressive strokes/arteriosclerosis; these medical crises complicated his judgment and intractability during the crucial League of Nations ratification campaign. Scholars like Weinstein and Berg are cited for this view. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which historian’s phrase does Nichols cite to argue that the Wilsonian impulse persisted into later decades as an influential paradigm ('Wilsonian century')?",
    choices: [
      "Richard Hofstadter",
      "Frank Ninkovich",
      "Arthur Schlesinger Jr.",
      "E.H. Carr"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols cites Frank Ninkovich’s argument about a 'Wilsonian century' to show how Wilsonian ideas — particularly liberal internationalism — persisted as a governing paradigm well beyond 1921. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which critical view does E.H. Carr represent in Nichols’ chapter, regarding Wilson’s League project?",
    choices: [
      "That the League was flawless and should have been immediately universalized.",
      "That Wilsonian legalism and aspiration overlooked power realities and therefore was naive.",
      "That the League was mainly an American imperial tool to dominate Europe.",
      "That Wilson simply wanted a peacetime jobs program disguised as diplomacy."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols invokes E.H. Carr’s realist critique: Wilson’s aspiration — a legalistic emphasis on norms and institutions — failed to accommodate power politics, rendering the League inadequate for the harder realities of interwar diplomacy. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which archival project substantially improved scholarship on Wilson by opening his papers to researchers and enabling fine-grained analysis?",
    choices: [
      "The Roosevelt Papers Project",
      "The Papers of Woodrow Wilson (Arthur Link)",
      "The Carnegie Endowment Diplomatic Papers",
      "The Taft Papers Archive"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols emphasizes Arthur Link’s multi-volume 'Papers of Woodrow Wilson' as transformative — enabling better analysis of Wilson’s decisions, health, and the Paris negotiations. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Nichols suggests the reception of Wilson's legacy in the 1920s Republican administrations (Harding, Coolidge, Hoover) was best described as:",
    choices: [
      "Complete ideological continuity — the Republicans fully adopted Wilsonian foreign policy.",
      "Rhetorical repudiation of Wilson in many respects, while retaining certain administrative/regulatory structures.",
      "Total erasure of all Wilsonian domestic reforms and international commitments.",
      "A secret bipartisan effort to immediately join the League of Nations."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols argues Republicans often rhetorically rejected Wilsonianism ('normalcy' rhetoric), yet many Wilsonian administrative achievements (tax machinery, regulatory institutions) persisted — the rejection was not absolute in practice. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which of the following best captures the 'moralism/idealist' historiographical layer Nichols describes?",
    choices: [
      "A focus on judicial decisions only.",
      "Concern with Wilson’s religiously inflected rhetoric and the moralism underpinning his internationalism.",
      "An economic analysis of tariff schedules.",
      "A purely biographical interest in Wilson’s childhood."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols identifies a strand of scholarship that locates Wilsonian idealism in Wilson’s moral and religious language—scholars debate whether his 'redemptive' rhetoric was a virtue or a political flaw. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "When Nichols discusses 'legal fetishism' in relation to Wilson, he is referring to:",
    choices: [
      "Wilson's personal obsession with obscure statutory drafting rules.",
      "A tendency in US foreign policy to over-rely on legal instruments and pronouncements (eg. League, Stimson Doctrine) as solutions to political conflict.",
      "An academic debate about the constitutionality of wartime measures.",
      "A preference for civil law systems in US legal reform."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols recounts critiques (Carr among them) that Wilsonian diplomacy promoted a faith in legalistic, declaratory solutions to complex power-politics problems — what he and others call a 'legal fetishism.' :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which 1918 policy statement is closely associated with Wilson’s program for postwar order and is central to Nichols’ discussion?",
    choices: [
      "The Monroe Doctrine",
      "The Fourteen Points",
      "The Truman Doctrine",
      "The Kellogg-Briand Pact"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      The Fourteen Points (January 1918) are central to Nichols’ account: they encapsulated Wilson’s vision of a 'peace without victory,' self-determination, and a rules-based international order which fed into the League idea. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "A subtle interpretive point Nichols stresses about Wilson and progressive politics is that:",
    choices: [
      "All progressive reform during 1913–1916 originated exclusively in the White House.",
      "Much legislative innovation pre-dated Wilson or emerged from Congress/state actors, complicating attributions of 'authorship' to the President alone.",
      "Wilson invented progressivism single-handedly.",
      "Progressivism disappeared entirely after 1916."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols acknowledges historiographical work showing that many reforms associated with Wilson had roots in earlier progressive efforts or were pushed by Congress/ states — complicating simplistic 'presidential credit' narratives. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which phrase best captures Nichols’ view of how Wilson functions in the politics of the 1920s?",
    choices: [
      "Wilson as forgotten footnote — entirely irrelevant to subsequent policy.",
      "Wilson as a persistent rhetorical and conceptual touchstone; a foil and a model in different registers.",
      "Wilson as a European monarchist.",
      "Wilson as an agrarian populist opposed to modernization."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols frames Wilson as simultaneously a foil for the Republican 'normalcy' rhetoric and an enduring conceptual ancestor whose ideas continued to inform debates about federal power and international engagement. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which of the following is NOT one of the three historiographical layers Nichols lays out (progressivism; moralism; health/psychology)?",
    choices: [
      "Progressivism — was Wilson authentically progressive?",
      "Moralism/Idealism — how moral and ideological was his internationalism?",
      "Health/Psychology — did strokes/personality shape outcomes?",
      "Economic determinism — an explicit Marxist materialist critique (as Nichols frames it)."
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: `
      Nichols centers three interpretive layers (the progressivism question; the moralist/idealist reading; and the role of Wilson’s health/personality). A pure economic-determinist Marxist critique is not presented as one of his central three layers. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which piece of evidence does Nichols (and cited scholars) use to argue that Wilson’s health was politically relevant?",
    choices: [
      "The sudden collapse of the US economy in 1917.",
      "Medical evidence and archival material documenting strokes and arteriosclerosis during 1919–1920 that correlate with political stubbornness.",
      "Wilson’s immediate resignation in 1918, which left office vacant.",
      "His decision to move the capital to Richmond."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols cites archival and medical scholarship (Weinstein, Berg, Link) that trace strokes/arteriosclerosis during 1919–1920 and link these to episodes of political intransigence such as his refusal to accept League reservations. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which later US administration does Nichols (via cited scholars) compare to Wilson in rhetorical ambition (not necessarily method), noting continuities in rhetoric about American global purpose?",
    choices: [
      "The Nixon administration",
      "The George W. Bush administration",
      "The Eisenhower administration",
      "The Truman administration"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols notes scholars (eg. Andrew Bacevich) who discern rhetorical continuities between Wilsonian claims of American international responsibility and later administrations such as George W. Bush — especially in terms of claims about US global indispensability. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which of the following best describes Nichols’ assessment of how historians’ views of Wilson have changed over the twentieth century?",
    choices: [
      "They became uniformly negative from the 1920s onward.",
      "They have oscillated — early celebratory accounts, mid-century critiques, then later nuanced reassessments that recover complexity.",
      "Historians have never revisited Wilson since 1924.",
      "Consensus emerged immediately that Wilson was the best president of the century."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols traces shifting historiography: early praise, then criticism (mid-century), followed by later nuanced, archivally informed reassessments that complicate simple caricatures. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which of these claims about Wilson is supported by Nichols’ chapter?",
    choices: [
      "Wilson wholly abolished executive power in favor of Congress.",
      "Wilson helped institutionalize modern federal capacities (taxation, central banking) that shaped twentieth-century governance.",
      "Wilson advocated a permanent US military occupation of Europe.",
      "Wilson was indifferent to international law and favored only economic isolation."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols argues Wilson’s presidency institutionalized key federal capacities (income tax machinery, Federal Reserve) that were consequential for later governance — a core claim about his domestic legacy. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Nichols uses the example of the 1912 election to show:",
    choices: [
      "How Roosevelt’s third-party run (Progressive Party) helped split Republican votes and aided Wilson’s victory.",
      "That Wilson lost the 1912 election overwhelmingly.",
      "That Congress refused Wilson any legislative wins in 1913.",
      "That the 1912 election was solely about tariff policy."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `
      Nichols notes the 1912 split — Roosevelt’s Progressive insurgency split Republican support, which advantaged Wilson and allowed Democrats to take the White House. :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "What is Nichols’ stance on whether the 1920s were 'anti-progressive' entirely?",
    choices: [
      "He insists progressivism vanished completely after World War I.",
      "He suggests progressivism did not simply disappear; elements persisted in policy and administrative growth.",
      "He claims the 1920s were an unbroken socialist decade.",
      "He argues the 1920s are irrelevant to the study of progressivism."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols — citing scholars like Dumenil and Skowronek — warns against the notion that progressivism died in the 1920s: certain administrative and regulatory patterns and reforms persisted. :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}
    `
  },

  {
    q: "Which methodological caution does Nichols identify when applying present-day categories to Wilson's ideas?",
    choices: [
      "Presentist misapplication — extracting modern meanings from Wilson without regard to his historical context.",

    choices: [
      "They were wholly separate and had no mutual effect.",
      "Wilsonian domestic reforms and international ambitions were intertwined; his domestic administrative expansion shaped his international program and vice versa.",

      "He had no domestic agenda at all."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols stresses the integration of domestic and international strands in Wilson’s program: domestic administrative reform reinforced his credibility and capacity to pursue an internationalist agenda. :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}

    ],
    correct: 1,

      "A purely local New Jersey political phenomenon."

    correct: 1,

    q: "According to Nichols, which of the following best explains why Wilson became a 'foil' in the 1920s?",
    choices: [
      "Because he literally moved into a different country.",
      "Republican politicians used Wilson as a rhetorical contrast to justify 'normalcy' while his institutional imprint nevertheless continued to operate.",

    correct: 1,

      "Prove that historical analysis is impossible."
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `
      Nichols argues engaging Wilson’s legacy enables historians to see continuities and transformations, showing the 1920s as consequential and connected to earlier Wilsonian developments. :contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}

      "Wilson’s adoption of communism in 1919.",
      "Wilson’s consistent implementation of laissez-faire economics without exception."

      Nichols highlights the tension between Wilson’s high rhetoric (League, moral aims) and the realpolitik compromises and domestic constraints that complicated their implementation — especially in the Paris negotiations. :contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}
