        "The role of context",
        "The role of grammar"

      answer: 0,
      explanation: "Lecture V is a “Plea for Excuses,” focusing on how excuses differ from infelicities."
    },
    {
      question: "According to Austin, an excuse differs from an infelicity in that it:",
      options: [
        "Prevents the act from being performed",
        "Justifies or pardons an infelicitous act",
        "Alters the grammatical structure",
        "Changes the literal meaning"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation: "Excuses do not invalidate the act but provide reasons to justify or pardon it."

        "Hitch"

      options: [
        "An infelicity",

        "Removing the required felicity condition",

        "Changing the propositional content",
        "Triggering a perlocUTION"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation: "Duress compels compliance, but the utterance still counts; it’s merely excused."
    },
    {
      question: "Which scenario exemplifies a proper excuse?",
      options: [
        "A judge pronouncing sentence while dizzy",
        "A mistaken baptism of a plant",

        "Infelicities",

    },
    {
      question: "In discussing excuses, Austin emphasizes:",
      options: [
        "The difference between failure and pardon",
        "That all infelicities can be excused",
        "That sincerity guarantees felicity",
        "That context is irrelevant"
      ],
      answer: 0,
      explanation: "He draws a line between invalidity (infelicity) and pardon (excuse)."
    },
    {

      options: [
        "A brief addendum",

        "A complete revision of previous lectures",
        "A dismissal as irrelevant"
      ],
      answer: 0,
      explanation: "Lecture V is a relatively short discussion, an addendum to infelicities."
    },
    {
      question: "Which of these is NOT discussed as an excuse in Lecture V?",
      options: [
        "Insanity",

      options: [
        "Meaning differs from force",
        "The utterance fails completely",
        "The audience misinterprets",
        "The speaker is insincere"
      ],
      answer: 0,
      explanation: "Indirect acts have a literal meaning but convey a different illocutionary force."

        "Font style",
        "Sentence length"
      ],
      answer: 0,
      explanation: "Tone, stress, and pauses can signal that a literal question is actually a request."
    },
    {
      question: "According to Austin, which of these is NOT needed for indirect speech?",
      options: [
        "Familiar participants",
        "Rich contextual cues",
        "Explicit performative verb",
        "Shared background norms"
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation: "Indirect speech works without explicit performative verbs if context suffices."

      options: [

      explanation: "The speaker performs an illocutionary request under the guise of a statement."
    },
    {
      question: "The perlocutionary act primarily concerns:",
      options: [
        "The literal content",
        "The speaker’s intention",
        "The effect on the hearer",
        "The grammatical form"
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation: "Perlocutionary acts focus on the effect—like persuading, amusing, or warning."
    },
    {

      options: [
        "Direct speech",

        "Perlocution",
        "Felicity"

      answer: 1,
      explanation: "Metaspeech refers to talking about the speech act itself, e.g. “I call this…”."

      question: "“Could you pass the salt?” is an example of:",
      options: [
        "Direct speech act",
        "Question only",
        "Indirect speech act",
        "Pure perlocution"
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation: "Though phrased as a question, it functions as a polite request."
    },
    {

      options: [
        "Grammatical clues",
        "The felicity conditions",
        "Contextual knowledge",
        "Lexical semantics"
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation: "Context and shared norms reveal the speaker’s intended force."

      options: [
        "Misinvocation",

    },
    {
      question: "In written performatives, Austin notes that the word “hereby”:",
      options: [
        "Is optional",
        "Marks the utterance itself as the action",
        "Alters propositional content",
        "Indicates a quotation"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation: "“Hereby” signals that the written text is performing the act itself."

      options: [
        "Underline key words",

        "Always succeed",
        "Never require performative verbs",
        "Misfire without visual cues",
