const questions = [
  {
    q: "1. What is a morpheme in linguistics?",
    choices: [
      "A syllable in a word",
      "The smallest meaningful unit in a language",
      "A prefix or suffix only",
      "A type of phoneme"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning or grammatical function in a language. (Booij, <em>The Grammar of Words</em>, 2007, p.1; Lieber, <em>Introducing Morphology</em>, 2021, p.5)`
  },
  {
    q: "2. What distinguishes a 'free morpheme' from a 'bound morpheme'?",
    choices: [
      "Free morphemes can stand alone as words; bound morphemes cannot",
      "Free morphemes are affixes; bound morphemes are roots",
      "Free morphemes do not carry meaning; bound morphemes do",
      "Bound morphemes can stand alone; free morphemes cannot"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `Free morphemes are independent words (e.g., "book"), while bound morphemes (e.g., "-s") must be attached to another morpheme. (Aronoff, <em>Minimalist Morphology</em>, 1994, p.12)`
  },
  {
    q: "3. Which of the following is an example of a prefix?",
    choices: [
      "-ing",
      "-ed",
      "un-",
      "-s"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `Prefixes attach before the root, as in "unhappy". Suffixes, like "-ing" and "-ed", attach after the root. (Lieber, 2021, p.21)`
  },
  {
    q: "4. What is an infix?",
    choices: [
      "A morpheme occurring at the beginning of a word",
      "A morpheme occurring within a word",
      "A morpheme occurring at the end of a word",
      "A morpheme that does not change meaning"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `An infix is a morpheme inserted inside another morpheme or root, such as "-um-" in Tagalog. (Spencer & Zwicky, <em>The Handbook of Morphology</em>, 2017, p.117)`
  },
  {
    q: "5. What does 'lexicon' refer to in linguistics?",
    choices: [
      "The grammar of a language",
      "The set of phonemes in a language",
      "The mental store of words and morphemes",
      "The syntax rules of a language"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `The lexicon is the mental repository of a speaker's vocabulary, including morphemes, their meanings, and properties. (Booij, 2007, p.35)`
  },
  {
    q: "6. What effect do suffixes commonly have in English?",
    choices: [
      "Change meaning or grammatical category of a word",
      "Only adjust stress patterns",
      "Shorten the word",
      "Appear only at the beginning of words"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `Suffixes like "-ness" or "-able" typically change meaning or word class (e.g., "happy" → "happiness"). (Lieber, 2021, p.48)`
  },
  {
    q: "7. What is reduplication?",
    choices: [
      "Repeating all or part of a word to change meaning or form",
      "Adding a prefix to a word",
      "Removing suffixes",
      "Pronouncing a consonant twice"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `Reduplication is the process of repeating part or all of a morpheme to convey grammatical or semantic information, common in Austronesian languages. (Spencer & Zwicky, 2017, p.253)`
  },
  {
    q: "8. Which is an example of a bound root?",
    choices: [
      "Cat",
      "Un-",
      "Culp- (as in 'culpable')",
      "-s"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `Bound roots, like "culp-", cannot stand alone and require affixes to form words. (Booij, 2007, p.60)`
  },
  {
    q: "9. Difference between open-class and closed-class morphemes?",
    choices: [
      "Open-class rarely change; closed-class are flexible",
      "Open-class are closed sets; closed-class are open",
      "Open-class can expand with new words; closed-class are mostly fixed",
      "Open-class morphemes only occur together"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `Open-class morphemes (nouns, verbs) grow with new words; closed-class morphemes (pronouns, prepositions) are fixed. (Lieber, 2021, p.72)`
  },
  {
    q: "10. What is templatic morphology?",
    choices: [
      "Roots formed by consonantal templates with vowels inserted",
      "A method of counting syllables",
      "Using prefixes exclusively",
      "Repetition of morphemes"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `Templatic morphology is characteristic of Semitic languages, where roots are consonantal patterns combined with vowels to form words. (Aronoff, 1994, p.88)`
  },
  {
    q: "11. What is a bound morpheme?",
    choices: [
      "A morpheme that can stand alone",
      "A morpheme that must attach to others",
      "A morpheme that represents prepositions only",
      "A morpheme representing a full word"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Bound morphemes cannot stand alone and must attach to free morphemes (e.g., "un-", "-s"). (Booij, 2007, p.18)`
  },
  {
    q: "12. The distinction between prefix, suffix, and infix is based on:",
    choices: [
      "Where the morpheme attaches in the word",
      "The meaning added to the word",
      "Its grammatical function",
      "If it is bound or free"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `Prefixes attach before a root, suffixes after, and infixes inside the root. (Lieber, 2021, p.38)`
  },
  {
    q: "13. Which is NOT an open-class morpheme?",
    choices: [
      "Nouns",
      "Verbs",
      "Adjectives",
      "Prepositions"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: `Prepositions belong to closed-class morphemes; nouns, verbs, and adjectives are open-class. (Aarts, <em>Oxford Modern English Grammar</em>, 2011, p.45)`
  },
  {
    q: "14. What is special about the past tense morpheme in Tagalog?",
    choices: [
      "It is a prefix",
      "It is an infix",
      "It is a suffix",
      "It does not exist"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `In Tagalog, the past tense morpheme is an infix '-um-' inserted inside the root. (Spencer & Zwicky, 2017, p.119)`
  },
  {
    q: "15. How does the English plural suffix '-s' vary phonologically?",
    choices: [
      "Always pronounced 's'",
      "Always pronounced 'z'",
      "Pronounced /s/, /z/, or /ɪz/ depending on the root word",
      "It is silent"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `The plural suffix '-s' is realized as /s/, /z/, or /ɪz/ depending on phonological environment (cats /s/, dogs /z/, horses /ɪz/). (Booij, 2007, p.120)`
  },
  {
    q: "16. How does the mental lexicon treat complex words like 'cats'?",
    choices: [
      "As single indivisible units",
      "As root plus meaningful suffix",
      "As random sounds",
      "Ignoring plural suffix"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `The lexicon stores words as roots plus affixes, supporting productive morphology (cat + -s). (Lieber, 2021, p.55)`
  },
  {
    q: "17. What is morphological analysis?",
    choices: [
      "Parsing sentences into words",
      "Analyzing phonemes in speech",
      "Breaking words into morphemes and analyzing meaning/function",
      "Studying semantics only"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `Morphological analysis segments words into morphemes and studies their grammatical and semantic roles. (Aronoff, 1994, p.15)`
  },
  {
    q: "18. What type of morpheme is '-er' in English words like 'teacher'?",
    choices: [
      "A prefix",
      "A suffix denoting agent",
      "An infix",
      "A root"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `The suffix '-er' forms agent nouns from verbs (teach → teacher). (Booij, 2007, p.73)`
  },
  {
    q: "19. What is truncation in morphology?",
    choices: [
      "Adding sounds to words",
      "Removing parts of a word to create a new form",
      "Repeating a morpheme",
      "Softening pronunciation"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Truncation deletes part of a word to derive related forms (e.g. 'exam' from 'examination'). (Spencer & Zwicky, 2017, p.264)`
  },
  {
    q: "20. How do tonal languages use tone morphologically?",
    choices: [
      "Tone carries no meaning",
      "Tone distinguishes word meanings and grammatical functions",
      "Tone is only used in poetry",
      "Tone replaces consonants"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `In tonal languages, tone differences mark distinct lexical or grammatical meanings. (Lieber, 2021, p.97)`
