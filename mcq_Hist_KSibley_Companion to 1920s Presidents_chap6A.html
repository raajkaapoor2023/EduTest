  {
    q: "Which scandal is most closely associated with Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall during Harding’s presidency?",
    choices: [
      "The Teapot Dome affair — secret leasing of naval oil reserves to private companies for personal profit.",
      "The Whiskey Ring — illegal distilling tax evasion scheme.",
      "The Credit Mobilier scandal — fraudulent railroad contracts.",
      "The Watergate burglary — illicit break-in of the Democratic headquarters."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne places Teapot Dome at the center of Harding-era corruption: Fall secretly leased naval oil reserves (Teapot Dome, Elk Hills) to private oilmen and later accepted personal loans and gifts, for which he was convicted. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "How does Payne characterise Harry Daugherty’s role in Harding’s administration and subsequent scandals?",
    choices: [
      "As Attorney General who exercised political control over patronage and was repeatedly accused of corruption and obstruction, though often shielded by partisan allies.",
      "As a reforming Attorney General who investigated all corruption zealously.",
      "As Harding’s vice president.",
      "As the primary whistleblower exposing Teapot Dome."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne examines Daugherty’s influence as political manager-turned-Attorney-General; allegations included toleration of corrupt associates and interference with prosecutions — controversies that dogged Harding’s legacy. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "Which administrative office’s scandal involving Charles R. Forbes is examined by Payne?",
    choices: [
      "The Veterans Bureau — Forbes was implicated in fraudulent contracts and embezzlement related to veterans’ hospitals and supplies.",
      "The Post Office — for forging stamps.",
      "The Department of Agriculture — for price-fixing grain.",
      "The Federal Reserve — for printing counterfeit notes."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne reviews Forbes’s malfeasance as head of the Veterans Bureau: misuse of funds, bogus construction contracts, and kickbacks that led to Forbes’s conviction and imprisonment. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "What general point does Payne make about the timing of scandals in relation to the campaign and nomination?",
    choices: [
      "Many of the worst abuses and exposures occurred after Harding’s inauguration; a number of actors who later figured in scandal were active in campaign roles but the administrative misconduct unfolded in office.",
      "All scandals were widely known and fully litigated before the election.",
      "Scandals were invented years later with no basis in fact.",
      "Scandalous acts were exclusively the work of foreign agents."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne emphasises that while some associates were already controversial, the large-scale revelations (Teapot Dome, Forbes, Daugherty inquiries) became visible after Harding took office and during the early 1920s. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "Which interpretive caution does Payne stress when assessing Harding’s personal responsibility for administration scandals?",
    choices: [
      "That historians must distinguish between Harding’s personal knowledge/intention and the independent criminality of subordinates — archival evidence provides nuance that neither fully exonerates nor wholly condemns the president.",
      "That presidents are always personally responsible for every subordinate’s crime without need for evidence.",
      "That Harding confessed publicly to orchestrating all corruption.",
      "That no distinction between knowledge and responsibility is necessary for historical analysis."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne argues for careful parsing: some scandals reflected ministerial corruption rather than demonstrable direct orders from Harding, and archival context matters for evaluating culpability. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "Which institutional weakness does Payne highlight as enabling corruption in the Harding administration?",
    choices: [
      "A weak oversight regime in rapidly expanding postwar federal programs and a patronage culture that rewarded political loyalty over competence.",
      "An excess of congressional oversight that prevented any executive action.",
      "A comprehensive civil service that blocked corruption.",
      "An absence of a Treasury Department."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne points to administrative growth, weak procurement controls, and patronage politics as structural conditions that facilitated malfeasance. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "How does Payne discuss the role of investigative journalism and muckrakers in shaping public perception of Harding’s administration?",
    choices: [
      "Investigative reporting (and sensational accounts) magnified scandals and shaped public outrage, though some reports relied on dubious sources and later required archival verification.",
      "The press uniformly defended the administration and suppressed scandal.",
      "Journalists had no role and there was no press coverage.",
      "Journalists exclusively produced official government press releases."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne examines the interaction between press exposés, popular memoirs, and official probes; media coverage helped fix scandal narratives in public memory, even as some accounts were exaggerated. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "What is Payne’s treatment of the famous 'Gaston Means' narratives and their relation to Harding memory?",
    choices: [
      "Means’s lurid tales contributed to sensational public memory but were methodologically suspect — Payne treats them as influential cultural artifacts rather than incontrovertible evidence.",
      "Means authored the official Harding biography endorsed by scholars.",
      "Means served as Harding’s chief of staff and provided official documentation.",
      "Means was never associated with any accounts of Harding."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne discusses Means as a disreputable source whose sensationalism helped cement negative public images of Harding; historians must therefore evaluate such testimonies critically. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "Which legal outcome is associated with Albert Fall after Teapot Dome investigations?",
    choices: [
      "Conviction and imprisonment for taking bribes — Fall became the first former cabinet officer imprisoned for crimes in office.",
      "Exoneration and promotion to Chief Justice.",
      "Appointment as Secretary of State.",
      "No charges were ever brought against him."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne recounts Fall’s conviction in 1929 for accepting bribes in connection with oil reserve leases — a pivotal legal reckoning in the Teapot Dome saga. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "How does Payne explain the interplay between partisan politics and the corruption investigations?",
    choices: [
      "Investigations were often politically charged: Republicans defended colleagues while Democrats (and some Republicans) demanded accountability — partisan dynamics shaped both inquiry intensity and public interpretation.",
      "Investigations were entirely apolitical and universally welcomed by all parties.",
      "There was a complete absence of any congressional or legal inquiry.",
      "Only the Supreme Court conducted secret investigations without public record."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne notes that partisan considerations influenced how aggressively allegations were pursued and how they were framed publicly, complicating simple narratives of objective inquiry. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "What does Payne note about the timing of Harding’s death and its effect on scandal narratives?",
    choices: [
      "Harding’s sudden death in 1923 truncated immediate political reckoning and transformed some inquiries into posthumous probes, allowing memory and rumor to flourish in the interim.",
      "Harding lived to respond to every allegation and cleared his name completely.",
      "Harding died before taking office and thus was irrelevant to scandals.",
      "His death resulted in immediate legal immunity for all subordinates."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne emphasises how Harding’s death complicated accountability and allowed sensational reminiscences and contested narratives to enter the public record without the president’s clarifying testimony. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "Which long-term interpretive shift about Harding does Payne document in historiography?",
    choices: [
      "A movement from early scandal-driven condemnations toward more nuanced archival reappraisals that situate Harding in policy and institutional contexts — neither full exoneration nor unqualified condemnation.",
      "A consensus that Harding was the single greatest president ever.",
      "A uniform and permanent caricature that never changed after 1923.",
      "A view that Harding was secretly a foreign monarch."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne traces historiographical change: access to papers and methodical research prompted balanced reassessments, complicating mid-century caricatures. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "How does Payne approach the subject of Florence Harding’s public image and role in scandals?",
    choices: [
      "He treats sensational allegations about Florence cautiously — recognising their impact on memory while noting the weak evidentiary basis of some claims and the need for archival corroboration.",
      "He asserts Florence authored official corruption memos.",
      "He ignores Florence’s existence entirely.",
      "He states Florence was the only honest actor in the administration."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne analyses Florence’s role as both a visible figure and a target of rumor; he emphasises careful source analysis rather than uncritical acceptance of scandalous claims. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "What does Payne identify as the major institutional reform (or response) that emerged from the Harding scandals?",
    choices: [
      "Greater scrutiny over federal procurement and a gradual strengthening of oversight mechanisms, although many reforms unfolded slowly and unevenly.",
      "Immediate abolition of the executive branch.",
      "A law forcing presidents to be members of Congress before appointment.",
      "No changes occurred at any level of government."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne argues the scandals stimulated debates about oversight and procurement reform, though meaningful institutional changes advanced only gradually. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "Which of the following best captures Payne’s stance on assigning moral blame for the presidency’s scandals?",
    choices: [
      "A careful, evidence-based approach: distinguish direct orders from negligence and parse the archival record before apportioning blame to the president or subordinates.",
      "Immediate moral condemnation of Harding without investigation.",
      "Complete absolution of every actor without evidence.",
      "Assigning blame only to foreign governments."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne advocates discrimination between criminal intent and administrative failure — historians should rely on documents, not solely on later sensational accounts, in assigning culpability. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "How does Payne treat the role of the Department of Justice in the aftermath of scandals?",
    choices: [
      "As a contested institution — prosecutors pursued some leads, but political interference, resource constraints, and ambiguous authority complicated enforcement.",
      "As a uniformly effective and non-political machine that solved every case instantly.",
      "As a private contracting firm with no legal powers.",
      "As completely absent from any scandal response."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne notes DOJ prosecutions were uneven; political pressures and questions about jurisdiction affected how cases (Forbes, Fall, Daugherty inquiries) progressed. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "Which historianly warning about source use does Payne emphasise in his chapter on scandal and memory?",
    choices: [
      "That memoirs, sensational exposés, and partisan journalism must be triangulated with archival records since they may reflect perception more than verifiable fact.",
      "That memoirs are always more reliable than archival documents.",
      "That sensational accounts should never be considered even as perception evidence.",
      "That historians should only use oral legends without documentary support."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne repeatedly instructs readers to use sensational sources cautiously — they illuminate contemporaneous perception but are not substitutes for primary documentation when establishing facts. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "What does Payne say about congressional investigations into Harding-era scandals?",
    choices: [
      "They were important mechanisms of accountability, but their findings and political impact were shaped by partisan dynamics and evidentiary limits.",
      "Congress refused to hold any investigations at all.",
      "Investigations were purely ceremonial with no witnesses allowed.",
      "All congressional investigations unanimously absolved every accused official."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne sees congressional probes as central to public reckoning, yet notes their limits — politics, procedure, and evidentiary gaps often constrained outcomes. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "How does Payne treat the public memory of Harding in the decades after his death?",
    choices: [
      "Public memory was dominated for decades by scandal narratives and caricature, though academic re-evaluation gradually introduced more complexity into public understanding.",
      "Public memory instantly rehabilitated Harding to heroic status.",
      "Harding was never mentioned again in public discourse.",
      "He was remembered mostly for his scientific discoveries."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne documents how the Teapot Dome and lurid stories about Harding shaped public memory for many years, a trend slowly complicated by later scholarship. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "Which figure’s legal conviction does Payne cite as a decisive indicator that high-level corruption reached criminal culpability?",
    choices: [
      "Albert B. Fall — his conviction was a legal turning point demonstrating criminal culpability at cabinet level.",
      "Florence Harding — convicted for obstruction.",
      "Harding himself — convicted after his death.",
      "Harry Daugherty — convicted for embezzlement in 1921."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne highlights Fall’s conviction (1929) as the most significant legal confirmation that corruption in the Harding era reached criminal levels at cabinet rank. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "What does Payne suggest about the relationship between administrative expansion after WWI and opportunities for corruption?",
    choices: [
      "Rapid governmental expansion and new public programs after the war created procurement needs and discretion that, without robust controls, opened opportunities for graft.",
      "Governmental expansion had no relationship to corruption opportunities.",
      "Expansion eliminated any chance for corruption due to perfect oversight.",
      "There was no administrative expansion after WWI."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne connects postwar administrative growth with increased procurement and discretionary spending, structural conditions conducive to corrupt practices absent strong controls. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "How does Payne evaluate the claim that the scandals fully define Harding’s presidency?",
    choices: [
      "He rejects a reductive verdict: while scandals are central to Harding’s legacy, they coexist with policy initiatives and governance issues that complicate a solely scandal-driven portrait.",
      "He endorses the idea that scandal is the entirety of Harding’s presidency and nothing else matters.",
      "He claims there were no scandals at all.",
      "He argues that scandals were invented by later historians without basis."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne cautions against single-issue history: scandals loom large, but policy, institutional change, and broader context also matter in assessing Harding’s administration. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "What role does Payne attribute to archival releases (papers, correspondence) in revising Harding’s memory?",
    choices: [
      "They enabled historians to test sensational claims, to uncover nuance in administrative decisions, and to revise earlier conclusions where warranted.",
      "They had no impact on historical interpretation.",
      "They exclusively confirmed every sensational charge without nuance.",
      "They were all lost and thus irrelevant."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne credits the opening of documents with the capacity to refine or refute earlier claims and to produce more complex, evidence-based histories of Harding’s term. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "Which administrative actor’s testimony or written record does Payne treat as particularly illuminating for reconstruction of the scandals?",
    choices: [
      "Primary documentary records from officials (letters, memos) and court exhibits — Payne uses such documents to show how decisions and transactions unfolded.",
      "Only second-hand rumor collected in gossip columns.",
      "Dream journals published decades later.",
      "Weather reports from 1920."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne relies on documentary evidence (official correspondence, procurement files, trial records) to reconstruct events and to differentiate rumor from document-based facts. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "How does Payne treat the long-term political consequences of the Harding scandals for the Republican Party?",
    choices: [
      "They damaged the party’s moral standing temporarily and fed Progressive critiques, but Republicans remained electorally viable; the long-term effect was uneven and mediated by subsequent political developments.",
      "They caused the immediate dissolution of the Republican Party.",
      "They produced a permanent ban on Republicans holding federal office.",
      "They led to single-party rule by the Democrats for decades."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne indicates the scandals dented the party’s reputation and fueled critique, yet Republicans recovered electorally in subsequent cycles; the political cost was real but not uniformly terminal. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "What does Payne say about the historiographical role of later defenders (rehabilitators) of Harding?",
    choices: [
      "Defenders have used archival research to argue for contextualised interpretations emphasizing administrative accomplishments, but such reassessments do not uniformly erase evidence of corruption.",
      "Defenders universally denied archives existed.",
      "Defenders allocated blame to unrelated presidents instead.",
      "No defenders of Harding have ever existed."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne engages with rehabilitationist scholarship that argues for nuance and context while acknowledging that such work does not completely negate documented instances of graft. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "Which of the following best summarises Payne’s methodological advice for historians studying scandal and memory?",
    choices: [
      "Combine close archival work with attention to media narratives and public memory — assess both documentary truth and cultural impact rather than privileging one at the expense of the other.",
      "Ignore archival work and rely only on gossip.",
      "Use only polls and discard documents.",
      "Publish immediate sensationalist accounts before doing research."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Payne advocates a dual approach: reconciling documentary analysis with a study of the cultural production of scandal (press, memoirs) to understand both fact and memory. " + fileCitation
  },
  {
    q: "What conclusion does Payne draw about the possibility of fully 'rehabilitating' Harding’s reputation?",
    choices: [
      "Full rehabilitation is unlikely because some documented abuses reached criminal thresholds, but qualified reassessments can moderate older caricatures and restore neglected policy achievements.",
      "Full rehabilitation is achieved once historians stop researching.",
      "Rehabilitation is impossible because all archives were destroyed.",
      "Rehabilitation is unnecessary because Harding was never criticized."
