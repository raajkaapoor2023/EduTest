const questions = [
  {
    q: "1. What is an 'allomorph'?",
    choices: [
      "A prefix that attaches to verbs",
      "A variant form of a morpheme conditioned by context",
      "A type of free morpheme",
      "A type of suffix"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `An allomorph is one of the variant phonological forms of a morpheme that appear in different contexts (e.g., past tense '-ed' pronounced as /t/, /d/, or /ɪd/). (Richards, Lecture 3, 13:00–14:30)`
  },
  {
    q: "2. Which morpheme is exemplified by '-al' in words like 'industrial' and 'national'?",
    choices: [
      "A free morpheme",
      "A verb-forming suffix",
      "A noun-forming suffix",
      "An adjective-forming suffix"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: `' -al' is an adjective-forming suffix attaching to nouns (e.g., 'nation' →'national'). (Richards, Lecture 3, 2:30–5:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "3. What is meant by the 'input' and 'output' of a morpheme in morphological processes?",
    choices: [
      "The sounds before and after a morpheme",
      "The meaning given when a morpheme is added and the category it creates",
      "The free and bound status",
      "The root and stem"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `The input is the category or word a morpheme attaches to; the output is the new category or word resulting after attachment. For example, '-ation' attaches to verbs and outputs nouns. (Richards, Lecture 3, 5:00–8:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "4. The suffix '-ation' typically attaches to which class of words?",
    choices: [
      "Nouns",
      "Adjectives",
      "Verbs",
      "Adverbs"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: `'-ation' attaches to verbs (e.g., 'industrialize') to form nouns ('industrialization'). (Richards, Lecture 3, 7:30–8:30)`
  },
  {
    q: "5. How do different allomorphs of the English past tense suffix manifest?",
    choices: [
      "They always have the same pronunciation",
      "They appear in mutually exclusive environments (e.g., after voiceless consonants vs voiced)",
      "They are free morphemes",
      "The spelling changes but the pronunciation does not"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `English past tense '-ed' has allomorphs /t/, /d/, /ɪd/ depending on the phonological environment (e.g., /t/ after voiceless sounds). (Richards, Lecture 3, 12:00–15:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "6. According to Richards, what is the 'default' past tense allomorph in English?",
    choices: [
      "/t/",
      "/d/",
      "/ɪd/",
      "No default; all are equally likely"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `The default allomorph for the English past tense is /d/ as in 'fleeped' (a made-up verb example). (Richards, Lecture 3, 16:00–17:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "7. Why can't '-al' attach to verbs like 'industrialize' directly, but '-ation' can?",
    choices: [
      "'-al' only attaches to nouns; '-ation' attaches to verbs creating nouns",
      "'-al' is a prefix; '-ation' is a suffix",
      "'-al' is a free morpheme; '-ation' is bound",
      "Both attach only to adjectives"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `'-al' attaches to nouns ('nation'→'national'), while '-ation' attaches to verbs ('industrialize'→'industrialization'). (Richards Lecture 3, 6:00–8:30)`
  },
  {
    q: "8. What does Richards suggest about morpheme listing in the mental lexicon?",
    choices: [
      "Only words are listed, not morphemes",
      "Morphemes are listed with their pronunciation, meanings, and category info",
      "Phonemes are stored, not morphemes",
      "Morphemes are randomly organized"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Morphemes in the mental lexicon contain sound, meaning, and grammatical category info including if they are bound/free. (Richards, Lecture 3, 1:00–3:30)`
  },
  {
    q: "9. What role do 'input' and 'output' categories serve in morphological rules?",
    choices: [
      "They determine phonetic changes",
      "They specify the categories a morpheme can attach to and the resulting category",
      "They separate prefixes from suffixes",
      "They are only important for infixes"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Morphological rules specify that morphemes attach to inputs (e.g., verbs) and produce output categories (e.g., nouns). (Richards, Lecture 3, 5:00–9:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "10. How does Richards illustrate morpheme productivity?",
    choices: [
      "By showing irregular verbs only",
      "By using made-up words to explain default allomorphs and morphological expectations",
      "By focusing on fixed lexicon entries",
      "By ignoring allomorphy"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Richards invents verbs like 'fleep' to demonstrate how default morphological patterns and allomorphy operate productively. (Lecture 3, 15:30–17:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "11. What is an example of a morphological generalization Richards discusses?",
    choices: [
      "'-al' attaches only to nouns",
      "'-ed' creates present tense",
      "'-ing' attaches only to adjectives",
      "No suffixes attach to verbs"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `The suffix '-al' is limited to attaching to nouns to form adjectives, e.g., in 'industrial'. (Lecture 3, 2:00–4:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "12. Richards emphasizes the mental lexicon treats morphemes as:",
    choices: [
      "Simple sound patterns with no meaning",
      "Elements with linked pronunciation and meaning",
      "Entire words only, no decomposition",
      "Random parts of speech"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Morphemes have structured representations linking sound and meaning, crucial for linguistic competence. (Lecture 3, 1:00–3:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "13. How does the suffix '-ity' function morphologically according to Richards?",
    choices: [
      "It forms verbs from nouns",
      "It forms nouns from adjectives, e.g., 'sincere'→'sincerity'",
      "It denotes plural forms",
      "It creates adjectives from verbs"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `' -ity' attaches to adjectives to form nouns, like 'chaste' → 'chastity'. (Lecture 3, 9:30–11:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "14. Richards notes that allomorphy requires understanding:",
    choices: [
      "Phonetic environments shaping morpheme forms",
      "That all morphemes have one fixed form",
      "Free morphemes never change",
      "Affixes are always prefixes"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `Allomorphs appear conditioned by phonetic context, like the English past tense suffix. (Lecture 3, 10:00–14:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "15. Why are some morphological combinations impossible, e.g., '*industrializ-al'*?",
    choices: [
      "Because '-al' cannot attach to verbs directly",
      "Because 'industrialize' is not a real word",
      "All morphemes can combine freely",
      "The spelling is incorrect"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `'-al' attaches only to nouns, not verbs; 'industrialization' works because '-ation' creates a noun. (Lecture 3, 6:30–7:30)`
  },
  {
    q: "16. How does Richards demonstrate default assumptions about morpheme forms?",
    choices: [
      "By ignoring irregular verbs",
      "By predicting the formation of past tense for invented verbs like 'fleep' → 'fleeped'",
      "By memorizing all exceptions",
      "By relying on random choice"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `He explains the default past tense form for new verbs is '-ed' even if exceptions like 'leap'→'leapt' exist. (Lecture 3, 15:00–16:30)`
  },
  {
    q: "17. What does Richards say about complex words like 'industrialization'?",
    choices: [
      "They form by linear concatenation without constraints",
      "They form by morphemes layering in sequences with set attachment rules",
      "They are always exceptions",
      "They do not obey morphological rules"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Complex words build hierarchically via morphemes attaching to outputs of previous affixations. (Lecture 3, 6:00–8:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "18. What is the role of 'allomorphy' in morphological theory?",
    choices: [
      "To explain phonological variation with no rules",
      "To account for morpheme variants conditioned by environment and morphology",
      "To ignore irregular verb forms",
      "To describe only free morphemes"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Allomorphy accounts for systematic variant forms of morphemes (e.g., 'talked' /t/, 'buzzed' /z/). (Lecture 3, 12:00–15:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "19. What is meant by 'morphotactics' as discussed by Richards?",
    choices: [
      "Rules governing phoneme sounds",
      "Rules about the order and combination of morphemes in words",
      "Rules about sentence structure",
      "Rules about vocabulary"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Morphotactics are rules governing morpheme order and valid combinations in word formation. (Lecture 3, 4:00–6:00)`
  },
  {
    q: "20. What challenge does Richards highlight about productive morphology?",
    choices: [
      "That all words have regular forms",
      "That morphological rules apply even to novel and made-up words with exceptions",
      "That morphology is unrelated to phonology",
      "That all morphemes are phonologically invariant"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: `Morphology is productive, applying rules to new words, but some words show irregular or exceptional allomorphs. (Lecture 3, 14:00–16:00)`
