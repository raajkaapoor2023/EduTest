const baseQuiz = [
  {
    q: "What best describes the central strategic feature of Harding’s 1920 'front porch' campaign?",
    choices: [
      "A deliberate decision to minimize travel and create controlled, repetitive public appearances from his Marion home while using surrogates, press, and staged visitors to reach the electorate.",
      "A coast-to-coast speaking tour in which Harding personally visited every major city.",
      "A radio-only campaign with no in-person appearances.",
      "An abstention from public campaigning in favor of policy memoranda distributed to editors."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick explains Harding primarily campaigned from his Marion 'front porch,' staging visits and giving prepared remarks while relying on a national organization for publicity — a conscious alternative to Cox’s intensive barnstorming. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "The 'smoke-filled room' episode at the 1920 Republican convention is best characterized, in Frederick’s account, as:",
    choices: [
      "A mythologized shorthand for backstage negotiation — memorable in popular lore but nuanced or rebutted by later archival and vote-tracking studies.",
      "An incontrovertible, single secret meeting in which a cabal hand-picked Harding and wrote the platform.",
      "A ceremonial dinner with no political relevance.",
      "A fabricated wholly by Democratic newspapers after 1920."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick recounts the smoke-filled room as an enduring image, but reviews revisionist scholarship (Bagby, Harris, Downes) showing the story is more complex: negotiations occurred but the simple 'conspiracy' narrative is overdrawn. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "Which three behind-the-scenes figures does Frederick identify as most central to directing Harding’s campaign?",
    choices: [
      "Will Hays, Harry Daugherty, and Albert Lasker.",
      "Samuel Hopkins Adams, Gaston Means, and Nan Britton.",
      "Woodrow Wilson, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Frank Lowden.",
      "Calvin Coolidge, James Cox, and Franklin Roosevelt."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick highlights party chairman Will Hays (organization and publicity), campaign manager Harry Daugherty, and advertising man Albert Lasker as key shapers of strategy and messaging. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "How does Frederick describe Will Hays’s contribution to the Republican campaign machine in 1920?",
    choices: [
      "As an innovating full-time chairman who professionalized fundraising, publicity, and national coordination.",
      "As a negligible figure who had little influence on the campaign.",
      "As an opponent of Harding who tried to derail the nomination.",
      "As Harding’s chief speechwriter and policy architect."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick (citing Goldman) argues Hays essentially invented the modern full-time chairmanship — mediating factions, coordinating fundraising and publicity for Harding’s campaign. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "What role did Albert Lasker play in Harding’s campaign, according to the chapter?",
    choices: [
      "He applied modern advertising and publicity techniques to promote Harding’s image, borrowing commercial advertising practice for political ends.",
      "He served as Harding's vice-presidential running mate.",
      "He led the Democratic opposition to Harding.",
      "He was a scandalous informant who fabricated stories about Harding."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Lasker, a leading advertising executive, helped style Harding’s public persona and messaging — an early example of modern campaign advertising applied to presidential politics. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "What does Frederick emphasise about Harding’s stance on the League of Nations during the campaign?",
    choices: [
      "Harding maintained an ambiguous, intentionally noncommittal posture designed to mollify both internationalists and irreconcilables within his party.",
      "Harding declared unequivocally for immediate US entry into the League.",
      "He campaigned explicitly for a unilateral rejection of all international pacts.",
      "He ignored foreign policy entirely throughout the campaign."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick notes Harding’s ambiguity on the League was tactical: by avoiding a firm stance he could appeal to both pro-League moderates and isolationist Republican factions. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "Which Democratic candidate contrasted strategically with Harding by conducting an intense cross-country tour?",
    choices: [
      "James M. Cox (with Franklin D. Roosevelt as running mate).",
      "A. Mitchell Palmer.",
      "Woodrow Wilson.",
      "Robert M. La Follette."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick contrasts Cox’s energetic nationwide touring with Harding’s front-porch approach — Cox covered thousands of miles while Harding emphasized controlled appearances. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "How does the chapter characterise the role of Florence Harding in the campaign?",
    choices: [
      "As an active front-porch hostess and adviser whose presence and management of visitors and events were integral to the campaign’s public presentation.",
      "As entirely absent from campaign affairs.",
      "As Harding’s primary speechwriter.",
      "As the person who wrote the party platform."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick (and Sibley’s related scholarship) emphasize Florence’s prominent role: hosting, advising, and shaping the social staging of the Marion front-porch events. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "Which charge involving Harding’s ancestry appeared during the campaign and how significant was its electoral effect?",
    choices: [
      "Claims by William Estabrook Chancellor alleging African-American ancestry — they stirred controversy but had little effect on the election outcome.",
      "Claims that Harding was an immigrant from Canada that caused his defeat.",
      "Charges that Harding had falsified his military record and costing him the election.",
      "An allegation that Harding was secretly a Socialist, which swung the Midwest."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Chancellor’s allegation of Black ancestry created local controversy and is well-documented in chapter sources, but historians conclude it did not materially change the national result. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "How does Frederick treat the 'Ohio Gang' and its relationship to the campaign?",
    choices: [
      "He notes early connections — some campaign associates later formed the nucleus of the Ohio Gang, but the scandals that followed largely post-dated the campaign itself.",
      "He claims the Ohio Gang was a Democratic fabrication with no basis.",
      "He shows that the Ohio Gang ran the Democratic campaign.",
      "He argues the Ohio Gang was wholly responsible for Harding’s nomination at the convention."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick explains many of Harding’s associates from Ohio later became associated with corruption (Ohio Gang) — but the worst abuses unfolded after the election and presidency began. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "Which explanation does Frederick give for why the 'smoke-filled room' story became so durable in American political memory?",
    choices: [
      "It provided a simple, vivid narrative of elite manipulation that fit broader skepticism about party bosses and made for compelling popular histories.",
      "Because the meeting literally took place and left voluminous minutes.",
      "Because the Senators publicly announced they had chosen Harding in an official statement.",
      "Because Harding wrote about it in his memoir."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "The 'smoke-filled room' endures because of its resonance as a symbol of backroom politics and because popular journalists amplified it, even as archival revisionism complicates the simple version. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "What evidence does Frederick cite to counter the most conspiratorial readings of the convention?",
    choices: [
      "Ballot records and contemporary accounts showing many switching patterns and no single pre-ordained plot to impose Harding on the convention.",
      "A secret audio recording proving the meeting never happened.",
      "That all delegates were absent from the convention.",
      "A handwritten confession by Will Hays."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick refers to vote tallies and revisionist historians (Bagby, Harris) who traced delegate behavior and concluded the nomination emerged from complex maneuvering rather than a single conspiratorial fiat. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "How does the chapter characterise the Republican platform / issues emphasis in 1920 relative to Harding’s persona?",
    choices: [
      "A mix of fiscal conservatism (taxes and spending restraint), promises of 'normalcy,' and cautious foreign-policy language — which Harding marketed through his persona of calming reassurance.",
      "A radical program of immediate nationalization of industry.",
      "An explicit pro-League, Wilsonian agenda.",
      "A single-issue campaign focused exclusively on tariff reform to the exclusion of everything else."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick underscores the campaign’s core themes (normalcy, economic stability, a retreat from Wilsonian activism) and shows Harding’s public image matched those priorities. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "Which factor does Frederick include as an important reason for the Republican landslide in November 1920?",
    choices: [
      "Voter fatigue with Wilsonian internationalism, postwar unrest, and a public desire for 'normalcy' combined with effective Republican organization.",
      "A sudden economic collapse in October 1920 caused voters to desert Democrats.",
      "A coalition between Harding and the Socialist Party.",
      "The death of the Democratic candidate before the election."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick argues the electorate’s reaction against Wilsonian policies, along with domestic weariness and strong Republican organization, explains the 1920 landslide rather than a single scandal or gimmick. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "What does the chapter say about the effect of women’s suffrage (the Nineteenth Amendment) on the 1920 election?",
    choices: [
      "Women’s suffrage introduced new electoral calculations; campaigns attempted to appeal to women, and analyses (then and later) debated the size and direction of the female vote — turnout patterns proved complex.",
      "Women were prohibited from voting in 1920.",
      "The amendment only applied to local elections, not presidential ones.",
      "Women overwhelmingly voted Socialist and changed the electoral map completely."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick notes the enfranchisement of women mattered for campaign strategy; historians have debated its immediate effect, but campaigns like Harding’s did explicitly court women voters. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "How are campaign finance and fundraising depicted in Frederick’s analysis of 1920?",
    choices: [
      "As significant and modernizing — with major spending on publicity and charges (later investigated) about campaign expenditures, placing money and organization at the center of the new politics.",
      "As entirely irrelevant to outcomes.",
      "As completely transparent and fully regulated by law.",
      "As dominated by small neighborhood bake sales."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick (citing Overacker and Kenyon’s investigation) highlights the growing scale and sophistication of campaign finance and the controversies that accompanied fundraising. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "Which third-party or minor campaigns does the chapter mention as noteworthy in 1920?",
    choices: [
      "Farmer–Labor, Socialist (Debs), and the Prohibition Party — each with varying regional impacts and limited national success.",
      "Green Party and Libertarian Party.",
      "No minor parties were on the ballot anywhere.",
      "A unified internationalist party that swept New England."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick discusses several minor parties (Farmer-Labor, Socialist, Prohibition) and their limited but locally relevant roles in the electoral map of 1920. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "According to Frederick, how should historians evaluate sensational post-election accounts (e.g., Means), when writing political history?",
    choices: [
      "With skepticism — treating them as sources about public perception rather than uncritical factual accounts; they require corroboration against archives.",
      "As definitive legal testimony.",
      "As the sole basis for historical judgment.",
      "As irrelevant and therefore never cited."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick draws a lesson: sensational works shaped memory but are methodologically weak; historians should use them as evidence about culture and reception, not as unquestioned factual records. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "What explanation does Frederick give for Harding’s selection as a compromise/consensus candidate at the convention?",
    choices: [
      "Deadlock among front-runners (Lowden, Wood, Johnson) and Harding’s acceptability as a broadly palatable figure led delegates to coalesce around him.",
      "Harding won on the first ballot with a huge majority and no deadlock existed.",
      "He was the only candidate on the ballot.",
      "He was randomly drawn from a hat as an electoral experiment."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick recounts convention dynamics: the inability of leading candidates to secure an absolute majority made Harding a compromise favorite in the later ballots. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "How does Frederick present the relation between Harding and his managers (Daugherty et al.)?",
    choices: [
      "As collaborative but contested: Harding exercised authority while managers shaped strategy and later became controversial figures in administration.",
      "As non-existent — Harding ran the campaign entirely alone.",
      "As wholly adversarial; managers tried to sabotage Harding.",
      "As a formal committee that never communicated with Harding."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick shows Harding was not merely a passive figure; he collaborated with advisers while men like Daugherty exercised influence and later attracted scrutiny. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "What was the chapter’s assessment of press coverage in the 1920 campaign?",
    choices: [
      "The press both amplified sensational claims and provided extensive coverage of stump speeches and platform differences — regional newspapers played important roles in shaping local perceptions.",
      "There was no newspaper coverage of the election.",
      "All newspapers were controlled by a single government office that censored news.",
      "The press unanimously endorsed Cox and suppressed Republican messages."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick documents how newspapers shaped narratives, including circulation of rumors and the prioritizing of dramatic stories; print media remained the dominant mass medium of the day. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "Which figure does Frederick identify as the major Republican who nearly became a candidate but was ultimately not the nominee?",
    choices: [
      "General Leonard Wood (and Frank Lowden were leading pre-convention figures before the deadlock).",
      "Gaston B. Means.",
      "Nan Britton.",
      "Samuel Hopkins Adams."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick recounts the pre-convention field (Lowden, Wood, Johnson) and how their failure to consolidate helped create the opening for Harding. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "What role did veterans’ issues and postwar policy play in the 1920 campaign, as described by Frederick?",
    choices: [
      "Veterans’ concerns (benefits, reintegration) were salient; both parties tried to appeal to veterans while national sentiment leaned toward stability after war-year turmoil.",
      "Veterans were excluded from the conversation entirely.",
      "Only foreign entanglements mattered; veterans were irrelevant.",
      "Veterans uniformly backed the Socialist ticket."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Postwar veterans’ needs were politically important; Frederick notes veterans’ issues figured in party appeals and helped shape the broader context for 'normalcy.' " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "How does Frederick treat the question whether Harding was a 'dark-horse' candidate?",
    choices: [
      "He argues Harding was not a pure dark-horse — he was known to party leaders and had co-favor status among some senators prior to the final ballots.",
      "He was entirely unknown and only discovered on the last day.",
      "Harding was nominated by acclamation on the first ballot.",
      "Harding was the incumbent President running for re-election."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick (with Sinclair and Murray) stresses Harding had recognition among Republican leaders and was plausibly a co-favorite rather than a spontaneous outsider. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "What does Frederick indicate about post-election scholarly focus on Harding?",
    choices: [
      "That attention shifted quickly to scandals, memory, and the long-term interpretive problems posed by sensational claims, producing waves of different historiographical approaches.",
      "That no scholar ever studied Harding again.",
      "That every historian immediately agreed Harding was the greatest President.",
      "That scholarship stopped because sources were inaccessible forever."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Frederick situates the campaign within the later historiographical focus: the scandals, memoirs, and subsequent archives shaped scholarly debate about Harding’s legacy. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "Which methodological lesson about campaign history does Frederick stress through this chapter?",
    choices: [
      "That rigorous use of archival material, attention to contemporaneous documents, and careful source criticism are necessary to correct or complicate popular narratives.",
      "That only oral tradition should be trusted.",
      "That rumor and scandal should be the exclusive evidence basis.",
      "That numbers of speeches alone determine electoral outcomes."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "The chapter repeatedly models archival scrutiny and cautions against uncritical reliance on sensational contemporary accounts — a broader methodological point for political historians. " + sourceCitation
  },

  {
    q: "What is Frederick’s assessment of Harding’s rhetorical content on the porch (what he actually pledged or emphasized)?",
    choices: [
      "He emphasized themes of restoration, calm, businesslike governance, and a return from wartime experimentation — rhetoric tailored to reassure a weary electorate.",
      "He promised radical socialist redistribution.",
      "He promised immediate US entry into a global empire.",
      "He refused to deliver any concrete message and only sang songs."
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Harding’s porch speeches were not empty — they communicated a coherent set of appeals (normalcy, stability, moderation) that resonated with large numbers of voters. " + sourceCitation

    choices: [
      "It was a turning point that signalled popular repudiation of Wilsonian politics and a public demand for domestic stability; the front-porch style and organizational modernity were both emblematic features.",
      "It was an insignificant event with no historical consequences.",
      "It led immediately to full bipartisan consensus on foreign policy.",
      "It created a permanent two-party coalition unchanged to this day."

    q: "How does Frederick say historians should treat the relationship between campaign myth and archival fact in this case?",

      "As a dialectic — myths (smoke-filled rooms, lurid exposés) shape public memory but can and should be tested, nuanced, or corrected by archival research.",
      "As indifferent: myth always prevails and archives do not matter.",
      "As irrelevant because no myths existed.",
      "As absolute: once a myth appears it can never be challenged by evidence."
