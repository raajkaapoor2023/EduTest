// ========== QUESTIONS DATA ==========

  question: "What was the 'return to normalcy' slogan most closely associated with in the 1920 presidential campaign?",
  options: [
    "International activism and progressive reform.",
    "A desire to return to prewar stability and avoid entanglements, after the trauma and idealism of World War I.",
    "The expansion of American imperial power overseas.",
    "A drive to join the League of Nations at any cost."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Harding’s call for “not heroics but healing… not revolution but restoration… not surgery but serenity… not the dramatic but the dispassionate, not experiment but equipoise” [Allen, Ch.2] was a conscious reaction to Wilson’s idealistic activism and the upheaval of the war years.`
},
{ // 2
  question: "According to Allen, what was one core reason for the Republican bosses selecting Harding as their 1920 nominee?",
  options: [
    "He was a fiery progressive in the style of Theodore Roosevelt.",
    "He stood out as a dramatic orator and idealistic statesman.",
    "He was affable, accessible, non-threatening, and uncontroversial—a 'safe' contrast to Wilson.",
    "He was an international expert with deep foreign policy experience."
  ],
  answer: 2,
  explanation: `Allen describes Harding as deliberately chosen for being “a commonplace and unpretentious Senator from Ohio… accessible to the last degree. Wilson had been adept at making enemies; Harding hadn’t an enemy in the world.” [Allen, Ch.2]`
},
{ // 3
  question: "What major event punctuated the end of President Wilson’s strength and the effective collapse of his leadership?",

    "The passage of the Eighteenth Amendment",
    "The Washington Naval Conference"
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Wilson’s desperate 1919 train tour to rally support for the League of Nations ended abruptly with a collapse—“he was feverish and… next morning when he tried to get up he could hardly stand… a few days later a cerebral thrombosis partially paralyzed his left side” [Allen, Ch.2].`
},
{ // 4
  question: "What immediate effect did the war's end have on the American public's outlook, according to Allen?",
  options: [
    "A strengthening of idealistic unity and world engagement.",
    "A sudden relaxation of idealism, disillusionment, and resentment of further obligations.",
    "A nationwide rush to join the Socialist Party.",
    "A renewed push for government expansion."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Allen writes: “The tension of the war was relaxing, the bubble of idealism was pricked…” and “the compulsion for unity was gone; division was taking its place” [Allen, Ch.2].`
},
{ // 5
  question: "Which issue most divided the American public in the two years after the war?",
  options: [
    "Whether to intervene in Latin America.",
    "Prohibition and alcohol enforcement.",
    "The League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles.",
    "The electric power industry."
  ],
  answer: 2,
  explanation: `“The Treaty issue was the most divisive in American political life between 1919–1920, drawing together odd coalitions of ‘irreconcilables,’ Wilson loyalists, ethnic groups, and those simply weary of war” [Allen, Ch.2].`
},
{ // 6
  question: "How did Allen characterize the 1919–20 'Red Scare' and its leaders such as Attorney-General Palmer?",

    "An overblown panic marked by executive overreach, disregard for civil rights, and lawless 'defense of law and order.'",
    "A necessary and proportional response to a real revolutionary danger.",
    "A period of international peace and progressive reform.",
    "A wave of pacifist activism."
  ],
  answer: 0,
  explanation: `Allen details Palmer’s “country-wide raid upon these dangerous men,” mass arrests, deportations, and a climate of “reign of terror,” calling it “an era of lawless and disorderly defense of law and order” [Allen, Ch.2].`
},
{ // 7
  question: "What were key social consequences of the postwar climate of 'normalcy' and political disengagement in the U.S.?",
  options: [
    "Universal public enthusiasm for controversial government investigations.",
    "Rising conformity, political apathy, and public disinterest in exposing government corruption.",
    "A sharp upturn in direct democracy and citizen activism.",
    "An immediate return to Progressive Era reforms."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Allen argues that the desire for “unobtrusive government” led to apathy in the face of scandal: “any relentless investigation of the scandals threatened to disturb the status quo, and disturbance of the status quo was the last thing that… the country at large wanted” [Allen, Ch.2].`
},
{ // 8
  question: "Which factor was *most* responsible, per Allen, for the Tea Pot Dome oil scandal's far-reaching impact?",
  options: [
    "Singular personal corruption by President Harding himself.",
    "A convergence of cronyism, lack of oversight, and a casual culture that tolerated 'practical politics'.",
    "Congressional refusal to ratify the Treaty of Versailles.",
    "Effective investigative journalism."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Allen describes a system of casual appointment—gifts of office to cronies—and a culture where “offices were plums,” Harding “handed them out like a benevolent Santa Claus,” and an inability “to distinguish between honesty and rascality” leading to endemic corruption [Allen, Ch.2].`
},
{ // 9
  question: "Allen’s narrative of early 1920s America stresses which main *mood* among ordinary citizens?",

    "Militant reformism and political engagement.",
    "Desire for healing, quiet, relaxation, and withdrawal from 'noble' crusades.",
    "Resurgence of utopian socialism.",
    "Apathy toward new technologies and consumer trends."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `“The nation was spiritually tired. Wearied by the excitements of the war… they hoped for quiet and healing. Sick of Wilson… callous to political idealism, they hoped for a chance to pursue private affairs without governmental interference” [Allen, Ch.2].`
},
{ // 10
  question: "How did the Harding administration's approach differ from Wilson’s, according to Allen?",
  options: [
    "Aggressively expanded federal regulation and direct-sponsorship of labor unions.",
    "Favored non-interference with business and the selection of 'good old friends' for office; an overall hands-off, genial approach.",
    "Drastically internationalized U.S. foreign policy.",
    "Launched new social welfare programs."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Harding “looked back with longing eyes to the good old days when the government didn’t bother businessmen with unnecessary regulations…” and was “not only a Senator, but a highly amenable Senator.” [Allen, Ch.2]`
},
{ // 11
  question: "What best describes Allen's analysis of Harding’s personality and decision-making style?",
  options: [
    "Sharp-witted, decisive, always personally hands-on with policy details.",
    "Intellectually vague, heavily reliant on advisers, universally affable, and sentimental in private life.",
    "Fiery orator, admired for his independent policy innovation.",
    "Relentless opponent of party machines."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Allen: “His mind was vague and fuzzy… Its quality was revealed in the clogged style of his public addresses… he was utterly dependent upon subordinates…” Harding “wanted to be helpful to neighbors from Marion and neighbors from campaign headquarters and to the whole neighborly American public.” [Allen, Ch.2]`
},
{ // 12
  question: "According to Allen, what was the major *public* reaction when the Harding scandals finally broke?",
  options: [
    "Massive outrage and a demand for major policy reforms.",
    "Greater condemnation for the investigators than for the perpetrators of corruption; public apathy overall.",
    "Huge public demonstrations demanding Harding’s prosecution.",
    "Resignation of most Republican leaders."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Allen writes: “the harshest condemnation… was reserved, not for those who had defrauded the government, but for those who insisted on bringing the facts to light… One of the leading super-patriots… said the whole oil scandal was the result of a gigantic international conspiracy…” [Allen, Ch.2]`
},
{ // 13
  question: "The Senate’s rejection of the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations was shaped most by:",
  options: [
    "Internationalist ideals.",
    "Bipartisan consensus for global engagement.",
    "A mix of political opposition, ethnic voting blocs, and public weariness of European entanglements.",
    "Narrow legal disputes over wording."
  ],
  answer: 2,
  explanation: `Allen: “There were hard-shelled tories like Brandegee; there were Western idealists like Borah, chronic dissenters… ethnic opposition… and vast public apathy to European problems.” [Allen, Ch.2]`
},
{ // 14
  question: "Which best summarizes Allen's view of the public’s relation to politics and policy after 1920?",

    "Militant progressivism resurged.",
    "Majority activism for labor reform."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `"The most that they required of the United States Government was that it should keep its hands off business… and be otherwise unobtrusive. They did not look for bold… statesmanship" [Allen, Ch.2].`

  question: "What did Allen see as the principal result of 'normalcy' in the federal government’s relation to business?",
  options: [

    "Hostile anti-business policy.",
    "Immediate passage of new antitrust laws."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Harding’s presidency “meant to give them as free a hand as possible ‘to resume their normal onward way’” [Allen, Ch.2].`
},
{ // 16

  options: [
    "Slow, piecemeal exposure and prosecution of graft—years after the events occurred.",
    "Unanimous bipartisan political outrage.",
    "Public excitement at “status-quo” affluence more than outrage at wrongdoing.",
    "Resentment of those who exposed scandals."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Unified bipartisan fury did NOT occur; Allen notes the opposite—“resentment… at the scandals and resentment at the scandal-mongers… gave way to a profound and untroubled apathy.” [Allen, Ch.2]`
},
{ // 17
  question: "How does Allen describe the fate of Woodrow Wilson as his presidency ended?",
  options: [
    "Honored and widely influential.",

    "Chosen for a third term."
  ],
  answer: 1,

    "The Readjuster Party.",
    "The Progressive Party."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `"Ku Klux Klan… grew, in fact, with such inordinate rapidity that early in 1924 its membership had reached… nearly four and a half million… It came to wield great political power… its objects included to maintain… white supremacy and… a pure Americanism." [Allen, Ch.2]`

    "Decreased influence of national advertising."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Allen notes: “the number of daily papers in the country dropped… [while] aggregate circulation … rose… papers were gathered into chains… syndicated features … guaranteed to tickle the mass mind.” [Allen, Ch.2]`

    "Dramatic but often trivial spectacles: boxing matches, murder trials, and celebrity scandals.",
    "Only foreign wars.",
    "Town hall debates."
  ],

    "Weariness of idealism and government activism.",
    "Desire for quiet prosperity and personal affairs.",
    "Universal confidence in international cooperation.",
    "A readiness to let the past be, and focus on the present."
  ],
  answer: 2,
  explanation: `"Confidence in international engagement" was not dominant. Allen notes the “relaxation that comes with peace…” and a “desire to be done with it” [foreign affairs]. Most wanted withdrawal, not activism.`

    "A surge in support for higher education.",
    "Government support for civil rights."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `“Almost inevitably it [fear/intolerance] took the form of an ugly flare-up of feeling against the Negro, the Jew, and the Roman Catholic. The emotions of group loyalty… found a perverted release in the persecution…” [Allen, Ch.2]`

    "They pursued a return to earlier practices and sought a candidate as different from Wilson as possible.",
    "They advocated energetic foreign engagement.",
    "They nominated only ex-generals."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `"You cannot teach an Old Guard new tricks... The only way they look is backward." Allen agrees: they wanted "a complete contrast with the idealist [Wilson] whom they detested" [Allen, Ch.2].`
},
{ // 24
  question: "Which of the following does Allen argue about the American businessman's psychology in 1919–20?",

    "Unbounded support for labor radicalism.",
    "Business prioritized employee equity above all."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `Allen: “He wanted to get back to business and enjoy his profits. Labor stood in his way and threatened his profits. He… developed a fervent belief that 100-per-cent Americanism… implied the right… to kick the union organizer out of his workshop… he had been nourished… on stories of spies and plotters…" [Allen, Ch.2]`
},
{ // 25
  question: "Allen notes public support for which aspect of prohibition?",
  options: [

    "Careful legal review and due process.",
    "A wave of evangelical Christian revival."
  ],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: `"His credulity had...stretched until he was quite ready to believe that a struggle of American laboring-men for better wages was the beginning of an armed rebellion directed by Lenin..." [Allen, Ch.2].`
