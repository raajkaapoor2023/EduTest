      o: [
        "Understanding general components is more important than memorizing many rules",
        "Memorizing rules exactly is essential",
        "Phrase structure rules are irrelevant",
        "Only one rule applies to all sentences"

      q: "18. How is the subject typically realized in phrase structure diagrams presented?",
      o: [
        "As a noun phrase (NP) occupying the specifier position of TP",
        "As an adjunct adverb",
        "Only as a determiner",
        "As a verb phrase"
